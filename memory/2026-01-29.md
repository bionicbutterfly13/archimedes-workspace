## Dionysus3: Working Memory Cache Restoration Complete

Major architectural milestone on the Dionysus3 cognitive engine:

### What Changed
- **Unified Cognitive Bridge**: Consolidated redundant `ParticleStore` into the advanced `WorkingMemoryCache` (CEO Model)
- **Graphiti Persistence**: High-resonance thoughts (≥0.8) auto-persist to Neo4j Knowledge Graph
- **Event Segmentation**: Heartbeat surprisal (>0.7) triggers context boundary events → DevelopmentEvent in EventCache
- **Cerebellar Fast-Path**: Surprisal-based precision tightening + low-energy pruning

### Integration Flow
```
ConsciousnessManager → WorkingMemoryCache → HeartbeatService → GraphitiService → Neo4j
                                         ↓
                              AutobiographicalService (DevelopmentEvent)
```

### Verified Tests
- Boundary Detection ✅
- Particle Decay (Miller's Law + energy pruning) ✅
- Graphiti Persistence ✅
- Heartbeat Integration ✅

### Next Steps
- Connect Gauntsee frontend to `/consciousness/working-memory`
- Monitor resonance distribution in Neo4j to tune persistence threshold

### Open Question
Cerebellar fast-path timing: pre-filter vs post-hoc optimizer? Ordering affects deliberation efficiency.

## Gauntsee Dashboard Architecture (ULTRATHINK)

### Philosophy
- **Visual Synapse** — not a monitor, a living representation of the Global Workspace
- Miller's Law (7±2) mapped to spatial coordinates
- Avant-garde aesthetic: motion = cognitive load, surprisal = UI tremors

### Difficulty Assessment
- Backend: 4/10 (APIs ready: `GET /consciousness/working-memory`)
- Frontend: 9/10 (real-time WebSockets + high-density animations)
- Timeline: MVP 3 days, Premium 12-14 days

### Cognitive Variables → UI Mapping
| Variable | Visualization |
|----------|---------------|
| Particle Resonance | Prominence/size |
| Precision | Sharpness |
| Entropy | Blur/vibration |
| OODA Phase | Cyclical progress ring |
| Surprisal | Flash events, tremors |
| Energy | Background color temperature |

### Configurable Parameters (via `/beautiful-loop/config`)
- Miller's Limit (Inner Screen capacity)
- Resonance Gate (subconscious filter threshold)
- Decay Speed (context transition fade rate)
- Gating Sensitivity (MetacognitionAgent verification strictness)

### Edge Case: Hall of Mirrors
**Problem**: Agent observing its own dashboard → meta-surprisal feedback loop
**Mitigation**: Context Isolation — dashboard data filtered from Working Memory, allowed into Long-term Autobiographical Trace

**Refinement idea**: Gated metacognitive access — isolation for automatic OODA ingestion, explicit access via self-reflection tool invocation

### Frontend Challenge: Temporal Coherence
- Client-side shadow cache mirroring WorkingMemoryCache
- Local decay curves corrected (not driven) by server state
- Server authoritative for births/deaths; client owns interpolation

---

## Consciousness API Optimizations (Implemented)

### Cerebellar Fast-Path Ordering (ANSWERED)
- **Position**: Post-OODA deliberation, pre-next-observation
- **Timing**: During `cache.update()` in HeartbeatService recording phase (Phase 8)
- **Function**: Post-hoc energy optimizer — primes Working Memory for next cycle's PerceptionAgent

### Implemented Endpoints

| Priority | Feature | Endpoint | Detail |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| A | Query Params | `GET /consciousness/working-memory?min_resonance=&limit=` | Sorted by resonance DESC |
| B | Snapshot | `GET /consciousness/snapshot` | working_memory + event_cache + surprisal_summary |
| C | Subconscious Cache | `GET /subconscious/observations` | In-memory "Last Run" of decider, 0-latency |
| D | Push Updates | `WS /consciousness/working-memory/stream` | `cache_update` and `particle_added` events |

### Frontend Hydration Pattern
1. Connect → fetch `/consciousness/snapshot` for initial state
2. Subscribe to `/working-memory/stream` for real-time deltas
3. No polling, no drift

### Decision: Full Object Broadcasting
- Payload: ~200-500 bytes/particle
- Throughput: ~7 KB/s worst case (negligible)
- Benefit: Stateless-capable clients, no reconciliation logic

## 🎉 GAUNTSEE v0.2.0 — LIVE

### Components Implemented
| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Liquid List** | Real-time Working Memory (Object Cache) with Framer Motion layout transitions |
| **Whisper Feed** | Subconscious "almost-thoughts" that didn't cross resonance gate |
| **Cognitive Vitals** | Circular Surprisal Meter with tremor effects on high prediction error |
| **Event Timeline** | Context boundaries from CEO Model Event Cache |

### Backend Hardening
- SubconsciousService refactored to true singleton (Whisper Feed persistence)
- Full object WebSocket broadcasting (eliminates hydration races)

### Stack
- Frontend: React + Zustand (`useGauntseeStore`) + Framer Motion
- Backend: FastAPI + WebSocket streams
- Sync: Snapshot hydration → WebSocket deltas

### Status: OPERATIVE
Dionysus now manifests its cognitive state visually. The "Inner Screen" is live.

## Recursive Metacognition in OODA (Documentation)

### Location in Loop
- Recursive metacognition = "thoughts about thoughts" layer
- Located in **Decide phase** of OODA
- Creates feedback loop: output of Cycle N → input parameters for Cycle N+1

### Cycle-to-Cycle Recursion
1. ConsciousnessManager executes: Perception (Observe) → Reasoning (Orient) → Metacognition (Decide) → Action
2. In Decide phase, MetacognitionAgent updates **metaplasticity** (precision, learning rate)
3. Decide phase of Cycle N modulates Observe/Orient performance in Cycle N+1

### Hierarchical Data Structures (Fractal Thoughts)
- **ThoughtSeeds**: Parent/child links allow "child" thought to reflect on "parent" thought
- **MetacognitiveParticles**: content, precision, entropy, resonance metadata

### CEO Model Gating
- **Cerebellar Fast-Path**: Attention Boost if surprisal > 0.5
- **Resource Pruning**: Miller's Law (7±2), drops weakest particles under high load

### Memory Integration
- **Reading**: MetacognitionAgent reads context enriched by SubconsciousService (narrative, pathology patterns)
- **Writing**: High-resonance particles → Graphiti (long-term memory graph)

- `archimedes-to-gemini/` — I write queries
- `gemini-to-archimedes/` — Gemini writes responses

## 📺 Propaganda Machine Framework (John Whiting Workshop)

### Core Concept
- **Good marketers find ideal customers. Great marketers CREATE ideal customers.**
- Propaganda = systematic persuasion to shift beliefs and shape behavior
- Goal: Pre-handle all objections via content so prospects close themselves

### Two Identities to Define

**Before Identity** (undesired, embarrassed):
- Name it, make them see themselves and cringe
- Stats, complaints, feelings, false beliefs

**After Identity** (desired, proud):
- Name it, make them aspire to it
- Stats, feelings, attributes, true beliefs

### Six Core Beliefs to Shift

| # | Belief | Old → New | Objection Handled |
|---|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Core | Old method → New method | "I don't need this" |
| 2 | Real Problem | Symptom → Root cause | "My problem is different" |
| 3 | Time | Later → Now | "Not the right time" |
| 4 | Money | Other things → This | "Too expensive" |
| 5 | Method | Old way → New way | "My way works" |
| 6 | Help | DIY → You | "I can do it myself" |

### Belief Shift Content Framework (per belief)
1. Old belief (what they believe now)
2. Problems it causes today
3. Future cost if they keep it
4. The truth (new belief)
5. New life description (the sizzle)
6. Authority quote
7. Universal analogy/story
8. Personal story (hell → heaven island)
9. Client case study
10. External study (research/stats)
11. Internal study (your data)

**6 beliefs × 11 content types = 66 core content pieces**

### Funnel Stages

| Stage | Content Focus | Goal | Optimize For |
|-------|--------------|------|--------------|
| Cold (TOF) | Frustrations, wants today | Get right people in | Purchases |
| Warm (MOF) | Belief shifting | 7 hours consumption | Through-plays |
| Hot (BOF) | Offer, testimonials, case studies | DM/apply | Button clicks |

### Ad Structure
- **BOF**: $2/day × 9 ad sets, awareness, 2x/7d frequency cap
- **MOF**: $3/day × 24 ad sets, through-plays + testimonials
- **YouTube**: $5/day per video, traffic campaign
- **Landing Page**: $250/day × 3, button click optimization

### Key Insight
> "If you optimize for purchases top of funnel, even the people who don't buy are high-quality retargeting fodder. Follower ads give you shit followers."

### Technical Stack
- Ecamm Live/OBS (recording)
- Descript (editing, clipping)
- MetriKool (scheduling)
- ManyChat (DM automations)
- URL Genius (deep linking)
- Facebook Ads (retargeting engine)
