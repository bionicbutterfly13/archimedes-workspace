# Session: Analytical Empath Framework Build
**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Session ID:** aef-framework-build

## What Happened

Dr. Mani shared extensive material synthesizing:
- Somatic Ignition Switch (body-based activation for frozen systems)
- Montgomery (2024) ADHD + Predictive Coding preprint
- Externalized Decision Structures (exoskeleton architecture)
- Triple-Bind Siege (insight + intellectualization + shame spiral)
- Empathic Override (mirror neurons hijacking interoception)
- ACC Atrophy Loop (willpower weakens without completion)
- Finality Illusion (false prediction triggering abandonment)
- 5 Windows / MOSAEIC (Sensations, Actions, Emotions, Impulses, Cognitions)
- Three-Phase Progression (mapping → repatterning → stabilization)

## Artifacts Created

1. `notes/neurocognitive-frameworks.md` — Initial synthesis
2. `notes/analytical-empath-framework.md` — Comprehensive reference (~15KB)

## Key Insight: Memory Architecture Gap

Dr. Mani raised critical concern: I'm pushing to flat files, not to the graph infrastructure (Neo4j + Graphiti) that Dionysus Core uses. This means:
- No attractor basin routing
- No meme valve propagation
- No temporal velocity tracking
- No meta-episodic learning
- Autobiographical memory not structural

## Action Taken

Spawned background agent `neo4j-setup` to:
1. Start Neo4j via Graphiti docker-compose
2. Design schema for framework concepts
3. Create migration script for graph ingestion
4. Report on Clawdbot integration path

## Source Documents Referenced

- IAS MOSAEIC Source of Truth (updated 1/22/2026)
- The Five Pillars of Synthetic Self-Awareness
- The-5-Windows-of-Awareness.pdf
- Montgomery (2024) Preprint on ADHD + Predictive Coding

## Offer Positioning Shift

Dr. Mani noted: reframe offers from features to transformations.
- Not "14-day course" but "go a full day without your mind dragging you backward"
- Frame from internal experience of analytical empath, not deliverables

## Vision: Graph as Document Model

Dr. Mani's architecture vision:
- Avatar searchable like a document
- Nested sub-elements with data
- Can "reach inside" and call features
- Graph semantics with document-model ergonomics

## Next Steps

1. Wait for neo4j-setup agent report
2. Once Neo4j running, ingest framework
3. Establish Clawdbot ↔ Graphiti integration
4. Memory operations flow to graph, not just files
