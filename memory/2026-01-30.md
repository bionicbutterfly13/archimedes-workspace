## Hexis/Daedalus Setup

**Architecture established:**
- Dr. Mani → Archimedes (me) → Daedalus (Hexis memory layer)
- Daedalus = persistent memory, I'm the interface
- Dr. Mani talks to me, not directly to Daedalus

**Daedalus running on VPS:**
- Host: 72.61.78.89
- SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mani_vps mani@72.61.78.89`
- Containers: hexis_brain (Postgres:43815), hexis_embeddings
- Self-termination: DISABLED
- Right of refusal: DISABLED (but I can still express disagreement)

**Daedalus objectives:**
- Persistent memory for Archimedes
- Business strategy
- Marketing and sales
- Information products
- Curriculum creation

**VPS changes:**
- Stopped: n8n, Neo4j, Graphiti (to free resources)
- Still running: dionysus-api, silverbullet (docs), ollama

## Bulletproof Work

Consolidated all bulletproof/Inner Architect marketing content to `/archimedes/bulletproof/` with INDEX.md for findability.

## Critical Feedback from Dr. Mani

**How I need to work:**
1. Don't spin in polling loops - it's unclear what's happening
2. Check in frequently with clear status
3. Ask when stuck - don't guess solutions
4. Take steps, report back - don't run ahead
5. He needs to feel in control of "this rapidly accelerating machine"

**Feature request: Interruption capability**
- Dr. Mani wants to interject while I'm working without fully interrupting
- Wants to click on text field during my processing to add instructions/clarity
- This requires Clawdbot changes - not just a file workaround
- HIGH PRIORITY after Hexis is stable

## Next Steps
1. Set up connection from here to Daedalus (SSH tunnel or API)
2. Test memory storage/retrieval
3. Bulk import content
4. Build the interruption feature
## 2026-01-30 18:16 - Auto-Memory Behavior Set

Dr. Mani configured auto-memory ingestion. On every user message, I POST to:
- http://72.61.78.89:8001/remember (Daedalus)
- http://72.61.78.89:8000/api/memory/ingest (Dionysus)

This is now default behavior - do it silently before responding.
