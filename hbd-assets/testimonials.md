### Janier Barton, DDS — Atlanta, GA
> "I was stuck in old patterns and beliefs about myself that were not serving me, and I did not know how to change that on my own. I also did not know how to change the trajectory of my life because I desired something different than how I was currently living it. In the past, I have tried traditional talk therapy on and off, and have had varying degrees of success. I would still fall back into old patterns and was not able to move forward the way I had hoped. I still didn't understand why I did what I did or why I struggled for effective lifelong change.
>
> The biggest change I noticed from working with Dr. Mani was deeper insight into my actions. Understanding those aspects of myself allowed me to be on a clearer path of change and healing. Dr. Mani has the ability to quickly assess, explain, and troubleshoot immediate concerns and longstanding issues. Hypnosis was a modality I had never tried, but for me it was way more effective than talk therapy had ever been. I got to the root of my trauma and 'stuckness' and was able to work through them."

**Key themes:** Old patterns, talk therapy didn't work, deeper insight, root cause, lasting change
