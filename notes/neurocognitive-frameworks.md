# Neurocognitive Frameworks

Notes on predictive coding, somatic interventions, and neurodivergent cognition.

## Somatic Ignition Switch

**Core insight:** A frozen analytical system needs *activation*, not sedation. Traditional relaxation techniques are counterproductive for "high-intellectual paralysis."

### What It Looks Like

1. **Safe Up-Regulation**
   - Activation protocols, not calming techniques
   - Goal: bridge stillness → motion without triggering threat response
   - Generate neural energy to initiate action

2. **Rhythmic Grounding**
   - Sensory rhythms bypass the analytical loop
   - Bottom-up process (body → brain)
   - Creates "neuroadaptive blueprint" allowing movement while mind still analyzes

3. **Micro-Yes (Titration)**
   - Break initiation into tiny, non-threatening physical movements
   - Secure body buy-in before analytical mind can argue
   - Bypasses threat-detection by starting with safety, not full commitment

4. **Somatic Anchor**
   - Physical cue placed at "point of performance" (exact moment action required)
   - Interrupts mental replay episodes
   - Provides physical traction—collapses intention → action gap from hours to minutes

### Key Mechanism

The switch uses the body to signal safety to the nervous system. Momentum creates clarity, not the reverse.

## ADHD as Divergent Predictive Models

**Source:** Montgomery, R.M. (2024). "Redefining ADHD in the Light of Predictive Coding and Active Inference." *Preprints.org* (not peer-reviewed). doi:10.20944/preprints202407.0801.v1

### The Reframe

| Traditional View | Predictive Coding View |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Broken attention filter | Different prediction weighting |
| Deficit in focus | Heightened prediction error sensitivity |
| Random hyperactivity | Motor action to resolve uncertainty |
| Impulsivity as failure | Mismatch between predicted/actual outcomes |

### Core Claims

1. **Divergent Predictive Models**
   - ADHD brains generate predictions that don't match sensory environment
   - Frequent prediction errors → constant attention shifting
   - Not "failing to attend" but attending to prediction errors

2. **Sensory Processing & Attention**
   - Increased sensitivity to unexpected stimuli
   - Frequent attention shifts to resolve prediction errors
   - "Chaotic attentional landscape" where focus continuously redirects

3. **Motor Control**
   - Hyperactivity = brain generating motor commands to correct perceived errors
   - Cycle of continuous motor activity when predictions unmet
   - Impulsivity = inability to inhibit when predicted ≠ actual outcomes

4. **Adaptive Aspects**
   - Heightened novelty detection
   - Rapid environmental scanning
   - Advantageous in high-variability contexts
   - Aligns with neurodiversity framing

### Clinical Implications

- Interventions should align predictive models with sensory inputs
- Cognitive training for prediction accuracy
- Neurofeedback for real-time model adjustment
- Pharmacology targeting dopamine/norepinephrine (prediction + reward systems)

### Limitations

- Preprint, not peer-reviewed
- Methodology thin on empirical validation
- More theoretical synthesis than original data
- Useful as conceptual framework, not clinical protocol

## Connections Between Frameworks

| Predictive Coding Frame | Somatic Ignition Frame |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Prediction error → attention shift | Analytical loop → paralysis |
| Motor action to resolve uncertainty | Rhythmic movement to bypass analysis |
| Misaligned priors cause freeze/chaos | Frozen perfectionism = stalled system |
| Bottom-up sensory correction needed | Bottom-up body signal initiates action |

### Shared Insight

Both frameworks suggest: **use the body to update the model** rather than thinking your way out.

The "micro-yes" is essentially a low-cost motor action that generates confirming sensory feedback, reducing prediction error without requiring full cognitive commitment.

### Intervention Direction

- Body-first, not mind-first
- Rhythm and movement bypass analytical loops
- Small physical actions generate momentum
- External anchors at point of performance reduce initiation friction
