# MOSAEIC Protocol - Complete Reference

**Mental Observation of Sensations, Actions, Emotions, Impulses, Cognitions**

*The Point of Performance framework for real-time awareness.*

## What Is MOSAEIC?

A real-time awareness tool designed specifically for analytical empaths. Works while you're living your life—during meetings, conversations, daily tasks, or stressful moments. Not traditional meditation requiring sitting still.

**The Goal:** Develop ability to observe what's happening in mind and body AS IT HAPPENS, creating space between experience and reaction.

## The 5 Observation Domains

### S - SENSATIONS
Physical feelings in your body, including the five senses plus intuition.
- *Examples:* "Tension in shoulders," "Tight chest," "Feeling of unease"

### A - ACTIONS
What you're doing or avoiding doing right now.
- *Examples:* "Fidgeting," "Avoiding eye contact," "Checking phone"

### E - EMOTIONS
The feeling tone underneath your thoughts.
- *Examples:* "Frustrated," "Anxious," "Excited but nervous"

### I - IMPULSES
Urges or desires pulling at you before they become actions.
- *Examples:* "Want to interrupt," "Urge to leave," "Impulse to prove myself"

### C - COGNITIONS
Thoughts, inner dialogue, or mental stories.
- *Examples:* "This isn't working," "I should know better," "They don't respect me"

## The 8-Step Practice (Goleman Integration)

### Step 1: Find Your Position
Sit comfortably or stand where you won't be disturbed. Not while driving or operating machinery.

### Step 2: Place Your Hand
Put one hand on your abdomen, watch it rise and fall. (Goleman's breathing technique from *Focus*.) Hand should rise on inhale (belly breathing), sink on exhale.

### Step 3: Focus on the Hand
Watch your hand move with each breath for 3-5 minutes. Let your hand's movement become your whole focus.

### Step 4: Notice When You Drift
Catch yourself when your attention leaves your hand. Don't judge—this is normal and expected. **The noticing is the actual skill you're building.**

### Step 5: Identify What Pulled You Away
Ask: "Which domain distracted me?"
- **S**ensation (body feeling, tension, intuition)
- **A**ction (what you're doing or avoiding)
- **E**motion (feeling tone underneath)
- **I**mpulse (urge before it becomes action)
- **C**ognition (thoughts, inner dialogue)

### Step 6: Gently Return
Bring attention back to your hand on your abdomen. **Each return = 1 rep.** You're building your mental muscle with every return.

### Step 7: Practice Throughout Your Day
Use Level 1 situations: waiting in line, traffic, boring meetings. Pick ONE domain to notice for 30 seconds.

### Step 8: Build Your Pattern Awareness
Track which 1-2 domains pull you away most often. These are your personal distraction patterns—valuable information.

## Quick Reference Versions

### 30-Second Emergency
1. Notice you're triggered/stressed/reactive
2. Find breath
3. Pick ONE domain to notice
4. Label it ("tension," "frustration," "urge to escape")
5. Take one more breath
6. Respond from awareness

### 2-Minute Tune-Up
1. Establish breath anchor (30 seconds)
2. Scan all 5 domains (1 minute)
3. Notice which one is most active (30 seconds)
4. Return to breath and continue your day

### 5-7 Minute Skill-Building
1. Start with Goleman's breathing (2-3 minutes)
2. Add domain identification when distracted (2-3 minutes)
3. Practice staying with challenging material (1-2 minutes)
4. End with breath anchor

## The Neuroscience: What's Actually Happening

### Default Mode Network (DMN)
The part that loves to replay old stories, worry about the future, or create elaborate protective narratives. For analytical empaths, this network is like a hamster on a wheel that never stops running. **MOSAEIC interrupts this loop.**

### Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)
Your brain's CEO—the part that can pause, assess, and choose a response instead of just reacting. Even one moment of awareness turns the lights back on. Regulates emotion, makes decisions, stays aligned with values.

### Salience Network
Decides what gets attention. Right now, it probably treats racing thoughts as VIPs while actual feelings get ignored. **When you label internal experiences, brain retrains itself to see inner signals as important, not threats.** Lowers emotional reactivity over time.

### The Four-Stage Cognitive Cycle

| Stage | Description | Brain Networks |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. Mind Wandering | Mind drifts into self-referential thoughts | Default Mode Network (DMN) |
| 2. Awareness of Wandering | Notice mind has wandered | Salience Network |
| 3. Shifting Back to Breath | Redirect attention from thoughts | Executive Control Network |
| 4. Sustaining Attention | Maintain focus, monitor drifts | Attention Control Network |

## How Domains Drive Each Other

**Nothing happens in isolation.** Each domain influences the others in a continuous loop. By observing these connections, you start to see your patterns and gain choice points where you can interrupt automatic reactions.

### Example Chains

**Sensations → Other Domains:**
- Tight chest → Anxiety (E) → "Something's wrong" (C) → Check phone (I→A)
- Shoulder tension → Roll shoulders (A) → Frustration (E) → "I carry too much" (C)

**Emotions → Other Domains:**
- Feeling anxious → Tight chest (S) → Shallow breathing (A) → "I'm not doing this right" (C)
- Feeling frustrated → Impulse to stop (I) → Shifting position (A) → "This isn't working" (C)

**Cognitions → Other Domains:**
- "I'm doing this wrong" → Frustration (E) → Tension (S) → Impulse to stop (I)
- "This is boring" → Restlessness (E) → Fidgeting (A) → Agitation (S)

## Real-World Scenarios

### Before a Difficult Conversation
- **S:** Tight chest, shallow breathing
- **A:** Avoiding eye contact, speaking softly
- **E:** Anxiety mixed with compassion
- **I:** Want to soften the message or postpone
- **C:** "I don't want to hurt their feelings"

**Response:** Acknowledge the compassion while staying committed to clarity.

### During a Presentation
- **S:** Racing heart, tense shoulders
- **A:** Speaking too fast, fidgeting with slides
- **E:** Excitement mixed with imposter syndrome
- **I:** Want to add more slides or over-explain
- **C:** "What if they ask something I can't answer?"

**Response:** Take three breaths, focus on serving the audience instead of proving yourself.

### After Receiving Criticism
- **S:** Heat in face, jaw clenching
- **A:** Crossing arms, leaning back
- **E:** Hurt, anger, disappointment
- **I:** Want to defend or shut down
- **C:** "They don't understand" or "This is unfair"

**Response:** Breathe, ask clarifying questions, separate the feedback from your worth.

## Building Your Practice: The Mind Gym Approach

Think of this as your mental gym. Each time you notice something and bring your attention back, that's a rep. You're training your mind the same way you train a muscle.

**Target: 15 minutes of reps a day** (possibly spaced out)

### Week 1: Foundation Building
- Pick one domain to focus on
- Notice it during routine activities
- No pressure to change anything—just observe

### Week 2: Adding Structure
- Tracking two domains
- Start using it during mildly stressful situations
- Still just observing, not fixing

### Week 3: Real-World Application
- Use all five domains before important conversations or decisions
- Practice the 30-second version during busy periods
- Begin making small adjustments based on what you notice

### Week 4: Integration
- MOSAEIC becomes automatic
- You catch patterns before they derail you
- You respond from awareness instead of autopilot

## Key Insights

**For Empaths with Trauma History:**
MOSAEIC keeps your brain engaged in structured observation rather than "letting emotions in." You're witnessing from a slight distance, not drowning in feelings. Creates the "wise mind"—space between experiencing mind (pure emotion) and rationalizing mind (pure logic).

**The Core Principle:**
Your brain isn't sabotaging you. It's trying to protect you. MOSAEIC helps you have a conversation with it instead of being hijacked by it.

**Each return to focus = one mental rep.** You're not failing when your mind wanders—you're succeeding every time you notice it happened.

## Mini-Assessment: Which Domain Runs Your Life?

Most analytical empaths have 1-2 domains that tend to hijack them under stress.

**Sensation-Dominant:** Body reacts before mind catches up. Highly sensitive to environments and energy.

**Action-Dominant:** Immediately want to DO something. Fidget, pace, or busy yourself when anxious.

**Emotion-Dominant:** Feelings hit like a wave. Absorb others' emotions easily. Get stuck in emotional loops.

**Impulse-Dominant:** Strong immediate reactions. Either act too quickly or freeze completely.

**Cognition-Dominant:** Mind races with thoughts and scenarios. Analyze everything to death. Trapped in mental loops.

Knowing your dominant pattern isn't about fixing yourself—it's about working with your natural wiring instead of against it.
