# IAS Validation Status

Honest assessment of what's validated vs. what's clinical application of validated principles.

---

## ✅ Independently Validated Foundations

These have research backing independent of IAS:

| Component | Research Base |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Memory Reconsolidation** | Nader, Schiller, Lane et al. |
| **Affect Labeling** | Lieberman et al. (UCLA) |
| **Identity-Value Model (IVM)** | Identity-based motivation research |
| **Predictive Coding** | Friston, Smith, Badcock |
| **Extended Mind Thesis** | Clark & Chalmers |
| **Point of Performance** | Barkley (ADHD clinical) |
| **Interoception Research** | Craig, Singer |
| **DMN/TPN Dynamics** | ADHD neuroimaging literature |
| **Polyvagal Theory** | Porges |

---

## 🔬 Clinical Applications (Awaiting Outcome Research)

These apply validated principles to ADHD context but lack independent validation:

| Component | Based On | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Inner Architect System** | Memory reconsolidation + Identity change + Affect labeling | Clinical synthesis awaiting outcome research |
| **MOSAEIC Protocol (5 Windows)** | Affect labeling research (Lieberman) | Application to ADHD context. Specific protocol untested. |
| **Conviction Gauntlet** | Memory reconsolidation principles | Clinical translation. No independent validation. |
| **Neuroadaptive Scaffolding** | Extended Mind + Distributed Cognition + Point of Performance | Clinical synthesis. |
| **Somatic Ignition Switch** | CPG activation + Polyvagal theory | Specific protocol untested. |
| **External Exoskeleton** | Extended Mind Thesis | Application to ADHD context. |

## 📐 Conceptual Frameworks (Not Research Constructs)

These are clinical/conceptual frameworks synthesizing validated components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Triple-Bind Siege** | Framework organizing DMN, RSD, prediction error research |
| **Empathic Override** | Framework organizing mirror neuron + interoception research |
| **Replay Loop** | Framework organizing rumination + DMN research |
| **ACC Atrophy Loop** | Framework organizing willpower + task completion research |
| **Finality Illusion** | Framework organizing predictive coding + abandonment |
| **The 20 Objections** | Sales/clinical framework, not research construct |

## Positioning Implications

**Honest framing:**
- "Based on validated neuroscience principles"
- "Clinical application of established research"
- "Awaiting formal outcome studies"

**NOT claiming:**
- "Scientifically proven"
- "Research-validated protocol"
- "Evidence-based" (in the formal sense)

**The truth:** This is sophisticated clinical synthesis of validated mechanisms, not an independently tested intervention. The components work in isolation; the specific combination and protocol await outcome research.
