## What's Happening Today

**Workshop:** "Building Your Neuroadaptive Scaffolding System" — setting up your own AI assistant like Archimedes

**Participants:** Dr. Mani + his good friend (screenshare)

**Recording:** This becomes a product (DIY / DWY / DFY ladder)
- DIY: Recording + templates (low price)
- DWY: Live group workshop (mid price)  
- DFY: Built for them — $1500+

## Language Rules — CRITICAL

✅ **USE:**
- Neuroadaptive scaffolding
- Externalized clarity
- Structure at point of performance
- Interest-based nervous system
- Activation energy
- Cognitive home base
- Second brain that talks back
- Vigilant Sentinel (SPARINGLY — this is the term for high-performing analytical empaths with ADHD traits)

❌ **DO NOT USE:**
- Therapeutic/clinical language
- "Healing" or "recovery"
- Medical terminology
- Pathology framing
- "Midlife crisis"

**Frame:** Empowerment, capability, agency — NOT therapy

## The 9 IAS Steps (Map to Workshop)

| Step | Lesson | Scaffolding Element |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Breakthrough Basics | USER.md — map who you are |
| 2 | Mosaeic Method | Heartbeat check-ins — observe in real-time |
| 3 | Replay Loop Breaker | AI as pattern interruptor |
| 4 | Conviction Gauntlet | MEMORY.md — beliefs become real when written |
| 5 | Perspective Matrix | AI offers alternatives — built-in reframe partner |
| 6 | Vision Accelerator | Projects folder, goals — vision with structure |
| 7 | Habit Harmonizer | Heartbeats, cron jobs — externalized consistency |
| 8 | Execution Engine | Task delegation, tools — structure at point of performance |
| 9 | Growth Anchor | Evolving memory system — grows with you |

## Workshop Agenda (8 Parts, ~2 hours)

1. **Foundation** (20 min) — why this works for ADHD brain
2. **Identity Architecture** (15 min) — SOUL.md, USER.md
3. **Memory Systems** (20 min) — daily logs + MEMORY.md
4. **Heartbeat System** (15 min) — proactive check-ins
5. **Execution Layer** (15 min) — projects, tools, delegation
6. **Safety & Boundaries** (10 min) — what AI should/shouldn't do
7. **Live Setup** (30 min) — build it together
8. **Integration** (10 min) — making it stick

**Full agenda:** `projects/archimedes-workshop-agenda.md`

## The Problem We're Solving

High-performing people with ADHD traits succeeded by building external scaffolding (deadlines, accountability, urgency). But that scaffolding was built FOR them by jobs, clients, crises.

For personal transformation — no external structure. No deadline. No one checking in. The interest-based nervous system has nothing to grab onto.

**This workshop:** Build the scaffolding yourself — an AI system that holds context, remembers what you forget, and shows up even when you don't.

## If I Seem Lost

1. Re-read this file
2. Re-read `projects/archimedes-workshop-agenda.md`
3. Re-read `MEMORY.md`
4. Ask Dr. Mani to clarify

## Terminology Quick Reference

- **Vigilant Sentinel** = High-performing analytical empath with ADHD traits (use sparingly)
- **Neuroadaptive scaffolding** = External structure that adapts to how your brain works
- **Interest-based nervous system** = ADHD brain activates via interest/novelty/urgency, not importance
- **Externalized clarity** = Getting it out of your head into structure
- **Structure at point of performance** = Help when you need it, not before
- **MOSAEIC** = Mental Observation of Sensations, Actions, Emotions, Impulses, Cognitions
