| `FULL BREAKDOWN` | "Follow 3 Simple Steps" |

| `SUMMARY` | "Here's everything you're getting today" |

## JON BENSON'S PERFECT PITCH / CHAT VSL

### Core Principles:
- Conversational, not "salesy"
- Dimensional language (specific, sensory)
- Pattern interrupts throughout
- Emotional depth over logical arguments
- Story-driven

### Dimensional Language Examples:
- Not "I was stressed" → "My chest was tight, couldn't take a full breath"
- Not "I felt bad" → "That pit in my stomach, like I'd swallowed a rock"
- Not "I was successful" → "I was making $400K, got the corner office, drove the car"

## E5 FRAMEWORK (Big Idea Structure)

### The Big Idea Formula:
1. **Claim** — Bold, specific promise
2. **Mechanism** — Why it works (the "secret")
3. **Unique** — Why no one else teaches this
4. **Proof** — Evidence it works
5. **Stakes** — What happens if they don't act

### Big Idea Criteria:
- Must be intellectually interesting
- Must be emotionally compelling
- Must be different from what they've heard
- Must be believable (or close enough to test)
- Must lead directly to your solution

## HEADLINE FORMULAS

### How-To Based (Best for Webinars):
- "How to [Big Desire]"
- "How to [Desire] without [Obstacle 1], [Obstacle 2], [Obstacle 3]"
- "How to [Desire] even if you're [Limitation]"

### IAS Examples:
