## Marketing Copy (Model Format)

**Deliverable:** Creating a Life Beyond Belief (Bonus from the Hidden Block Decoder)

**Feature:** 14 short videos (10 minutes each) where Dr. Mani walks you through the 14 most common limiting beliefs that create mental loops. Each session identifies the belief, traces where it comes from, shows you why your brain needed it, then guides you to a replacement belief that actually serves you. Designed as a two-week experience, one belief per day.

**Functional Benefit:** You see the competing prediction models running in real time. The limiting belief ("I'm not ready to start") competes with the empowering belief ("progress matters more than perfection") for control of your attention. You learn to recognize which model is winning and consciously shift the competition in your favor before the loop locks in.

**Experiential Benefit:** When you catch yourself spiraling on "I don't have enough time," you remember the session that showed you how scarcity predictions hijack your planning system. You interrupt the pattern early because you recognize the exact belief structure driving it. The affirmations aren't toxic positivity—they're competing predictions you're deliberately strengthening.

**Emotional Benefit:** You stop seeing yourself as broken or self-sabotaging. These beliefs made sense when your brain first built them. Now you're updating the predictive models with better information, not fighting yourself for being defective.

## Key Differentiator

This isn't standard affirmation work or "think positive" mindset training. It's based on the prediction model framework from Beautiful Loop + Selective Mind:

- **Limiting belief** = outdated prediction model that won the Bayesian competition
- **Replacement belief** = competing prediction you deliberately strengthen
- **The work** = shifting which model wins the competition for awareness

## Ties to Core Framework

| Concept | How It Shows Up |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Bayesian Binding** | Limiting vs. empowering belief competing for awareness |
| **Prediction Models** | Each belief is a prediction about how reality works |
| **Adaptive Narrative Control** | Consciously shifting which model wins |
| **Canalization** | Old beliefs carved deep grooves; new beliefs create new pathways |
