# Dr. Mani's Story: Hell Island → Heaven Island

## THE HELL ISLAND

### The Split Self
> "For a lot of my life, I felt like I was living as two people. Almost literally."

At Harvard — partying on the surface, ridiculously depressed underneath. Even while partying, the dark aspects would come out. Tendency to withdraw and disconnect.

- No joy of learning — wasn't intrinsically motivated
- Not driven by curiosity
- Wasn't standing on firm ground inside
- So busy defending the performance of who I am, proving value to self and others
- Shield protecting the person who had achieved getting into Harvard, but hit a weird intersection where whatever worked before absolutely wasn't working

### The Letdown
> "I expected somehow there would be a different person there. Suddenly I could do everything I wanted. I was free, independent. I thought I would become the person who could be happy and win and find my people. But that's not where my system led me. My system led me dark."

- Before drinking even started — weird, cavalier disconnection from people
- The person on the surface was fun to be around
- The person when people tried to get close — withdrawal
- Felt like something inside was truly insincere
- Afraid to let aspects of self out

### The Pattern Repeats
**PhD attempt:** Thought maturity would come. Still didn't like reading stuff that made no sense, painfully boring.

**Med school:** "The happiest days are from acceptance until orientation." Challenge didn't bring him to life as expected.

**Software/Tech:** Would feel like not using the medical part of his brain.

**Psychiatry residency:** Loved a lot of it, but — "I can't do this the rest of my life." Not the patient care, but the bullshit bureaucracy. Paper mistakes could be career-ending after a 30-hour shift.

### The Crashes
Multiple depressions. Each time:
- Would work to high visibility position
- Then lose interest, start fumbling
- Self-sabotage at moments of success
- Didn't trust himself to put himself in high-visibility positions

> "After a while I'd be like, screw this! Ironically, this does not happen with working with people."

### Rock Bottom
- Newborn was 6 months old when he and ex-wife separated
- Lost house, cars, depression
- Laid out in "abysmal gravity is ten times the usual force" depression
- Moved up north for public transportation after losing both cars
- Driving Uber with a medical degree and psych training

### The Ex-Wife's Cancer
During his most disempowered time — ex-wife got cancer diagnosis, chemo, multiple surgeries, metastasis, passed away. Had to raise the kids while entirely disempowered.

### The Wedding Story (The Shame Spiral)
Best friend's wedding. Barely scraped together money to go. Flight delayed, stuck in Vegas. Couldn't afford hotel. Ate into the money drinking at airport. Too ashamed to call. Never showed up. Never called. Didn't speak to him for 20 years.

> "It wasn't voluntary. My system would just shut down. I can't call him and tell him I can't go, because then I'd have to tell him I need to go back home and collapse."

### The Wall
> "I had created so much numbness over the years to protect myself. So much nonchalance about everything. To buffer from emotional ups and downs. This wall in how much I would let people in."

Married Charlotte. Everything was good on the surface. But felt another depression coming.

> "There was distance between my skin and my soul. All around, like insulation between my skin, my eyeballs, my ears, and everything outside. I could hug someone as closely as I wanted and still wouldn't feel the hug emotion."

> "The pain would have me wishing I could love them more."

## THE BRIDGE (What Shifted)

### The Decision: 30 Days Away
Went to rehab with trauma care. Asheville mountains. No phones, no internet, just letters. All day, every day, doing the work.

**Key realization:** None of the other stuff (antidepressants, anything) would work as long as he was drinking or smoking. Would never know what was really wrong.

### What Happened
- Started sleeping through the night for the first time in decades
- Slept hard, dreamed like crazy
- Did intensive outpatient for months after — 5 days a week, then 4, then 3
- Kept going

> "It wasn't so much about the work. It didn't matter what I was doing on the outside. What mattered was that whatever I was doing was symbolic of the commitment decisions I had made. Communicating to myself that this would do it."

### The Core Insight
> "The main thing I learned that changed everything was to stop trying to change myself and instead get wiser at creating systems outside of myself as I am to allow me to succeed."

Instead of shame when things came up:
- "What resource could I have used there?"
- Sometimes reaching out to a friend
- Sometimes leveraging stubbornness to persevere

### The Science That Clicked
Found a core set of scientific truths that made sense across the board. Relief of not needing to look for any more science or meaning.

> "Nothing out there is going to give me permission to feel something I'm resisting feeling."

### What Had to Go
- Other people's expectations superseding his own in his mental space
- Being someone whose potential was his punishment
- The performative, inherited, obligatory obligations
- The need to hurry to catch up to be successful
- The noise, itch, ungroundedness

### The Reframe
> "My potential shouldn't be my punishment."

> "If someone has a beautiful voice, they don't owe someone the rest of their lives suffering, singing so they can extract every drop of sound. If you're a comedian, you don't have to be every minute on command telling jokes."

## THE HEAVEN ISLAND (What's Different Now)

### The Settled State
> "If I'm sitting somewhere, there's not a compulsion to find something to create noise or drama or to take me away from what's going on in here. I can sit by myself and have nothing to do, and it's just what it is. No meaning except what I make of it myself. It feels true."

### What's Possible Now
- True peace of mind
- Choose the next thing without imagined scenarios of who I've let down
- No spy on a mountain keeping score
- Able to give care differently
- Can be quiet and let clients communicate how they want to get results
- Create a space where people can hear themselves — reflected off a mirror that won't be a funhouse mirror

### The Daily Reality
> "My eyes have been opened to things that allow each day to be its own gift. None of the currency of that day gets sucked out for performative, inherited obligations."

- Can dress how he's happy
- Doesn't have to attend events just to position himself
- Doesn't have to be on social media to show expertise
- Doesn't have to hurry to prove anything

> "If death came, my last thoughts would absolutely not be 'I wish I had more success.' Because I've — my eyes have been opened to things that allow each day to be its own gift."

### What Went Away
> "There was no amount of accumulation I could have done that would have filled the role. Or accomplished whatever my body and mind were looking for before they could be okay, at peace."

The noise, the itch, the ungroundedness — gone. Not filled, just... not needed anymore.

## WHY I DO THIS WORK

> "When I see others who have worked so hard to find themselves here, wherever they are, and be like 'This is it? This sucks. Why don't I feel this? Let me go work harder. Let me go convince people. Let me be seen here.' I can be like — yo, trust me, you can stop."

> "They trust me enough to try incrementally weird experiments and see if they get the results. Seeing those results and ultimately making change significant enough to be considered transformation. Knowing they never have to go back to the old way. They won't lapse into old patterns because they've crossed the chasm."
