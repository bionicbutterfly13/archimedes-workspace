## THE FULL TRANSFORMATION STORY (Raw Transcript)

### Where I Was Stuck

The gap I felt — my version of "successful but not fully expressed" — for a lot of my life, I felt like I was living as two people. Almost literally.

In undergrad at Harvard, I would do a lot of partying on the surface. But when I was not partying, I was ridiculously depressed. Even when I was partying, the dark aspects would come out somehow — in the way I engaged with people, my tendency to withdraw and be disconnected.

I wasn't really learning. I didn't get any of the joy of learning because I wasn't intrinsically motivated. I wasn't driven by any type of curiosity. I picked classes that I thought would tuck in with pre-med classes that I also hated. I loved science, but I wasn't as connected inside myself as I could have been. I could have been standing on firmer ground.

I was so busy defending the performance of who I am — proving my value, probably to myself and others — that there was too much of a shield around protecting the person who had achieved that, who had gotten into Harvard, but who suddenly hit a weird intersection where whatever I had been doing before was absolutely not working.

### The Harvard Letdown

The gap I felt that seemed insurmountable at the time was this realization that this was supposed to be my thing. I had finally accomplished this thing that I'd had in my mind since about seventh or eighth grade. It seemed impossible, but somewhere in me I knew I could. I put my head to it, ground it out, understood what it would take, and got it.

But then I got there, and the letdown was immense.

I expected there would be a different person there. Suddenly I could do everything that I wanted. I was free, independent, didn't have my parents' rules.

I thought I would become the person who could be happy and win and find my people.

But that's not where my system led me. My system led me to darkness. Even before I started drinking.

### Living As Two People

I had this weird, cavalier disconnection from people. The person I was on the surface — a lot of fun to be around — and the person I would be when people tried to get close to me. I felt like there was something inside me that was truly insincere.

I was afraid to let aspects of myself out.

### The Pattern Repeats

I got to med school after college. I tried to "find myself." I told my parents I was going to do an MD-PhD, that I'd do the PhD first. I grabbed a molecular biology PhD program, thought I would have matured, life would be different.

But I didn't like the feeling of reading stuff that made no sense and was painfully boring. In undergrad, it wasn't really about science — it was about being able to pursue this thing and hanging in there when a lot of people were getting knocked out.

I was like, "I'm going to win." The win was getting into med school. I got Chapel Hill, which I was super proud of.

But when I got to med school, I wanted to be there. I expected the challenge would bring me to life like challenges had before. But I remember sitting in lecture thinking, "Oh my God."

Someone said the happiest days in a student's life are from the day they get accepted until orientation. It was true.

### The Software Escape

My second year of med school, I had launched a site. I had come across Dreamweaver and had been a coder since I was nine. Encountering this new version of programming with the entire internet behind it — I fell right back in love with code.

The idea that I could sit here with thoughts and a desire to accomplish something and make it happen.

I launched sites that got traction. Spent more time on that than I should have in med school. In psychiatry residency, I spent even more time doing that.

By the time I was starting my psychiatry residency in 2006 — eleven years after college graduation — I had launched software companies. Small ones that didn't sell for much. In a lot of cases weren't worth anything other than the fact they fed me for a while.

But by residency, I had a pretty well-positioned consultancy.

### Parents' Intervention

My parents called. They said the software thing was risky, reminded me not to throw away opportunities. They made good arguments from a parental point of view.

So I did the psychiatry residency. I always loved psych. But I couldn't do this the rest of my life. It wasn't the way I wanted to practice.

A lot of it wasn't even about patient care — it was the bullshit bureaucracy. You could make a mistake — not even a big mistake, a paper mistake — and have it be career-ending. No one acknowledges that's a mistake someone would make after a 30-hour shift.

### The Split

I had already quit the path and gone out and done software twice. Had some success. Two pieces of software won awards — significant awards. Not under my name because I was a ghostwriter.

But when I was in tech, working cubicle life or with a startup, I wouldn't be happy because I felt like I wasn't using the medical part of my brain.

I realized I would have to find some way to make engaging things that would help people feel better.

### The Startup That Failed

I left my residency and joined a startup building virtual worlds — sports-related, kids nutrition. They burned through four million in six months after I moved to Atlanta to join them.

They fired all of us, two at a time. Hired a team of twelve rock stars, flew us in from all over the country. Made the mistake of grabbing a team where everyone was at that level — everyone had their opinion and style and track record. Didn't make for a great team.

### WebMD

I got a grown-up programming job at WebMD as a front-end engineer. Building software everyone was using — WebMD Health Checks, Ask the Expert. Building stuff from the ground up knowing everyone was coming to see it.

They were paying well.

But it didn't feel like... I felt like I was missing some point.

### The Collapse

It went on like that. Depression came because my system was like, "Screw it."

I shut down. Nothing changed until everything bottomed out.

I didn't want to carry any of the stuff I had. I was willing to let it all burn down — much to the chagrin of my wife and kids. I had a newborn six months old when my wife and I separated.

Lost the house, the cars. Depression. Everything you see in the movies.

### Driving Uber With an MD

I moved up north, got a place solo. Stuck because I was away from the kids — they were with their mom and her family, in much better shape than they would have been with me.

Most of the time I was laid out. Abysmal gravity — ten times the usual force type of depression.

Up north they have public transportation. I was able to get a roommate, build from the ground up using public transportation, then driving Uber.

Crazy because I was driving Uber with a medical degree and psych training.

### The Turning Point

What was so powerful about that being the turning point: driving Uber was what started turning things around. Suddenly I was generating my own revenue. No longer sitting there watching every day get worse.

Dark times were still ahead. My ex got a cancer diagnosis. Long chemo, multiple surgeries. It metastasized. She passed.

I had to raise the kids. Super scary during the time when I was entirely disempowered.

### The Realization

During that time, I came to realize there's a version of me that doesn't care about what people think about my success or failure. Who can make decisions and be good with them. A version of me who can actually lock in.

One thing I realized: I was pretty identified with the ADHD aspect of myself until I started working with clients in my coaching/hypnotherapy business. When my clients would talk, it was like code — I could lock in. I could see the problem from their point of view.

I found myself through their stories more connected with the moment.

### What I Tried (That Didn't Work)

- **Therapy** — various approaches
- **Antidepressants** — Zoloft initially, various others
- **ADHD meds** — some went better than others, some terribly. One doc had me on supraphysiological doses — still no peace
- **Meditation** — years of it. Nope.
- **Yoga** — neat, but couldn't stick with it. That's not how I'm wired.
- **Willpower/discipline** — never worked. Not once. My system finds passive-aggressive ways around it.

My brain decides to start doing something, commits to it, it becomes part of my identity, and I'm in. But discipline to start something new? Never worked.

### The Self-Sabotage Pattern

I would get in my own way. I could work no matter how hard until something... either right when I was about to get the thing, I would lose interest and fumble.

Usually after I had worked my way to a position of high visibility from being a model employee, winning awards, whatever.

I didn't trust myself to put myself in positions of high visibility and count on myself to even give a shit about performing. After a while I'd be like, "Screw this!"

**Except:** This did not happen with working with clients. Specifically working with my high-performing analytical empaths with traits of ADHD.

### The Breaking Point / Rock Bottom

Married Charlice. As far as circumstances, everything was awesome. She was cool, we had a blast, finally living together. I was a much more mature person. She was really good people. Lots of rapport.

But I felt another depression coming. Heavy. Where there was distance that I would feel increasingly bad about subjecting her to.

Not a surface distance — we would interact — but it was like I had retreated into a space where there was distance between my skin and my soul. All around, like insulation between my skin, my eyeballs, my ears, everything and what was outside.

I could hug someone as closely as I wanted and still wouldn't be able to feel the hug emotion.

It was like that with my kids too. The pain would have me wishing I could love them more. I had created so much numbness over the years to protect myself.

### The Rehab Decision

I had my training in hypnosis. I told clients I was shutting the business down for a bit because I needed to go away from it.

I was convinced that if I could go somewhere they could address something — I didn't even know what I needed to hear.

Thirty days away from everyone. No phones, no internet. Letters only. All day every day, just doing the work.

### What Changed in Rehab

I was in Asheville mountains. All day doing activities, a lot out in nature. Came home in amazing shape from running in nature. Lights out so couldn't be up super late.

I didn't consider any of the other stuff would work — antidepressants, anything — as long as I was drinking or smoking weed all the time. I would never know what was really wrong with me.

With nothing in my body during detox — no smoking, no drinking — just hella coffee. (I picked up a smoking habit which thank God I let go of.)

### The Shift

The shift was in my decision to listen to myself more.

When I came back home, I actually slept through the night. Like a baby. Which I hadn't for decades. Slept hard, dreamed like crazy.

I committed to an extended care program afterward — not inpatient but partial inpatient/outpatient intensive. Every day at first was five days a week all day, then four days, then three half days. Months and months of constant work.

I realized it wasn't so much about the work. It didn't matter what I was doing on the outside — walks, art therapy, sound therapy, nature therapy. I was like, let me do it.

**The Key Insight:** It wasn't what I was doing, but the fact that whatever I was doing was symbolic of the commitment decisions I had made. Communicating to myself that this would do it.

### The Core Realizations

1. **"Stop trying to change myself — instead create systems outside of myself AS I AM to allow me to succeed."**

2. Instead of looking for opportunities to feel shame or devalue myself, I would ask: "What resource could I have used there?"

3. It feels a lot better to have a tiny handful of people see me as I am — like it or not — versus a huge social media audience impressed by how many podcasts I could show up on.

4. **I could trust myself and my signal.** A lot of it wasn't that I was some weird, defective, broken person. This was the signal I had to navigate the world.

5. I needed to stop doing things as a result of having lost a perspective that valued me.

6. Let enough in without fear of it harming me or laughing at me for having needed its help.

7. **My potential shouldn't be my punishment.**

8. Letting things not working NOT mean I was broken or irreparable.

### The Difference Now

I show up. I'm me.

If I don't want to be somewhere, I'm not going. Other people can get in their feelings and that is absolutely not my problem.

As long as I've been in integrity and spoken kindly, I don't have to tell people my business. Don't have to hurry to catch up to be successful.

None of that runs in my head anymore — wondering why I'm not doing more live events, haven't written the ninth book, not working in a startup trying to launch the next unicorn.

**The biggest difference:** If I'm sitting somewhere, there's not a compulsion to find something to create noise or drama or take me away from what's going on. I can sit by myself with nothing to do and it's just... what it is. That's it. No meaning except what I make of it.

It feels true.

**What's possible is true peace of mind.** Choosing my next thing without imagined scenarios of who I've let down or how I've destroyed some potential life.

I'm able to give care differently. I can be quiet and let clients communicate how they want to get results and what will work for them. They can speak to hear themselves reflected off a mirror that won't be a funhouse mirror.

**If death came, my last thoughts would NOT be "I wish I had more success."**

My eyes have been opened. Each day is its own gift. None of the currency of that day gets sucked out for performative obligations.

I also got emptied of the need for those things. And emptied of noise and itch and ungroundedness that kept me from seeing or feeling what is here.

No amount of accumulation could have filled the role or accomplished whatever my body and mind were waiting for before they could be okay, at peace.

## SHORTER VERSIONS

### The 2-Minute Origin Story

I got into Harvard. Graduated. Got into med school. Finished my psychiatry residency. By every external measure, I had "made it."

But I was living as two people — the one who showed up confident and accomplished, and the one who lay awake replaying every conversation, convinced I'd said something wrong.

Then everything collapsed. A 3-to-4 year depression. My marriage ended. My business went under. At my lowest, I was driving Uber with an MD and psychiatry training.

I had all the insight, all the credentials — and none of it worked on me.

What finally shifted things wasn't more therapy or willpower. It was a 30-day intensive where I made one decision: stop trying to change who I am, and start building systems around who I already am.

Now I help other high-performers do the same. Because if this worked for someone who had everything and still couldn't find peace, it can work for you.

### The One-Paragraph Version

I'm a physician who spent decades studying why brilliant people stay stuck — and accidentally discovered a system that works. I didn't create this to become internet famous. I created it because I almost didn't survive without it. After getting into Harvard, finishing medical school and psychiatry residency, I still found myself in a 3-year depression, driving Uber, watching my marriage and business collapse. What finally worked wasn't more insight or willpower — it was learning to build systems around who I already am instead of trying to change myself. Now I help high-performing analytical minds do the same.
