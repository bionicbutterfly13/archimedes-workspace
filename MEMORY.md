## Primary Codebase: Dionysus Core
**Location:** `/Volumes/Asylum/dev/dionysus3-core/`

A VPS-native cognitive engine implementing consciousness-inspired patterns:
- Active inference (EFE minimization, precision weighting)
- Attractor basins, OODA heartbeat, Thoughtseeds framework
- Neo4j + Graphiti (temporal KG), smolagents orchestration
- MoSAEIC protocol (5-window experiential capture)

**Current track:** 002-jungian-archetypes — 12 Jungian archetypes as dispositional priors competing via EFE

**Dev protocol:** Conductor workflow mandatory, TDD, commits require `AUTHOR Mani Saint-Victor, MD`

## Active Project: Analytical Empath Framework / IAS

**The Hidden Block Decoder** → Now understood as the **Analytical Empath Execution Framework**

Core synthesis addressing the insight-embodiment gap:
- Triple-Bind Architecture (insight + intellectualization fortress + shame impairs ACC)
- Empathic Override (mirror neurons hijack interoception → "pilotless in own skin")
- Externalized Decision Structures (exoskeleton at point of performance)
- Somatic Ignition Switch (body-based activation bypassing analytical paralysis)
- 5 Windows / MOSAEIC (real-time observation framework)

**Key files:**
- `notes/analytical-empath-framework.md` — Comprehensive reference
- `memory/2026-01-28-aef-session.md` — Session log

**Critical gap identified:** My memory needs to flow into Neo4j/Graphiti, not flat files.
Sub-agent `neo4j-setup` working on infrastructure.

## Reference Repos
**Location:** `/Volumes/Asylum/repos/`

Key foundations:
- **Graphiti** — Temporal KG (Dionysus's Neo4j layer)
- **Nemori** — Episodic memory, Predict-Calibrate learning
- **MemEvolve** — Memory meta-evolution
- **Hexis** — Identity/ethics/consent/boundaries
- **aif_iwai2025_thoughtseeds** — The Thoughtseeds paper
- **smolagents** — Multi-agent orchestration

## HBD Sales Funnel (Active - Jan 2026)

**Goal:** Sell Hidden Block Decoder as $97 tripwire → $279 upsell

**Funnel:**
1. FB Ad (proven "stop replaying conversations" hook)
2. Opt-in page (24-40% CVR — WINNER)
3. Thank-you page → HBD $97
4. Upsell → $279 (Phase 2+3 bundle)
5. Email Day 3 → second shot at HBD

**HBD Deliverables (ready):**
- Beautiful Loop video ✅
- Selective Self video ✅
- MOSAEIC mini-course ✅
- IA Blueprint Stack (9 one-pagers)
- Pattern Recognition Protocol (PDF)
- Inner Aspect Guide (PDF)
- Weekend Guide to Roles & Rules (IFS)

**Sales page draft:** `projects/hbd-sales-page-v1.md`

**Target:** Affluent analytical empaths (MDs, therapists, educators) who replay conversations, tried therapy/coaching, nothing stuck

**Key mechanism:** Memory reconsolidation (not mindset, not willpower)

## Daedalus (Hexis) — My Memory Layer

**Architecture:** Dr. Mani → Archimedes (me) → Daedalus (persistent memory)

**VPS Location:** 72.61.78.89
**SSH:** `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mani_vps mani@72.61.78.89`
**Containers:** hexis_brain (Postgres:43815), hexis_embeddings

**Configuration:**
- Self-termination: DISABLED
- Right of refusal: DISABLED (I can express disagreement but not block)
- Objectives: business, marketing, sales, info products, curriculum

**Memory types:** Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Strategic
