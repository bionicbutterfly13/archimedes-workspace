## Best Client Ever: Katharine Harmon, MD

### Demographics
- **Profession:** Physician (established)
- **Age:** ~60s
- **Financial:** Affluent (both she and husband do well)
- **Status:** Accomplished, respected

### What She Wants (Surface Level)
- Wake up every day and **trust herself**
- Mood and productivity **not hostage to relationship state**
- Make the most of her remaining years
- Engage with new opportunities (AI, systems thinking)
- Stay in momentum, keep the fire lit

### What She Really Wants (Deep Level)
- Access the **"more"** she knows is there
- Stop **keeping herself from getting** to where she needs to be
- Close the gap between how others see her potential and how she feels inside
- Feel the fire that others can see from the outside

### Current State (The Tension)
- **External:** Success ✓ — Established physician, affluent, respected
- **Internal:** Unfulfillment ✗ — "Climbing to the floor of potential"
- Has had success before, so "what makes it hard to get unstuck?"
- Systems thinker who sees opportunities but busy work slows her down
- Knows she's successful but feels there's a place she's blocking herself from

### Core Insight
> "As successful as she knows she is, there's still that feeling that there's more — a place I need to be that somehow I'm keeping myself from getting."

This is **self-sabotage awareness without resolution**. She knows the block is internal, not external.

## Worst Client Ever: Courtney

### Behaviors
- **Needy, more talk than action**
- Wants to whine, tell every detail of issues
- Disconnects the moment solutions are offered — just wants to feel bad while being observed
- Doesn't take responsibility
- Didn't follow through
- Tried to guilt-trip for refund despite clear policy
- Reluctant to even hold a hand to be moved forward

### What She Believed
- Magical solution would just appear and make things easier
- Power of the next shiny object
- Listed all past expensive programs as "proof" nothing works for her
- **Enacted the belief she can't be fixed**
- Didn't believe she deserved anything

### The Energy
- Financially comfortable (husband does well) but **no hunger**
- No inner conflict — comfortable in victimhood
- Holds tight to the low level
- "Running backwards on a treadmill with high heels on, full speed, at an angle, on a hill, blindfolded, in the rain"

## The Core Distinction

| | Katharine (Ideal) | Courtney (Anti) |
|---|---|---|
| **Inner State** | Conflict: "I've got so much I want to accomplish, yet somehow I'm slowing myself down" | Comfort: Settled in struggle, no tension |
| **Fuel** | The gap between potential and current state creates drive | No gap — believes she can't be fixed |
| **When Stuck** | Reaches out: "I'm slipping, I'm not performing at my level" | Reaches out to whine, not to move |
| **Response to Solutions** | Curious: "Let me try this" | Disconnects: "That won't work for me" |
| **Belief** | "There's so much more talent I want to pour into the world" | "Nothing has worked, nothing will work" |
| **Money** | Willing to invest in what moves the needle | Collects programs as proof of brokenness |

## Identity Gap

### BEFORE Identity: "High-Performer, Still Stuck" (HPSS)
*(Where ideal clients start)*

- More talk than action
- Wants to feel bad while being observed
- Believes in magical solutions and shiny objects
- Lists past failures as identity ("I've tried everything")
- No inner conflict — settled in the struggle
- Financially okay but spiritually hungry for nothing
- Enacts the belief they can't be fixed
- Holds tight to the low level

### AFTER Identity: "The Inner Architect"
*(Attract this person)*

- Trusts herself daily
- Emotionally sovereign — mood not hostage to circumstances
- Fire visible inside AND out
- Intellectual curiosity: "Let me try this"
- Inner conflict as fuel: "I know I'm capable, so why am I slowing myself down?"
- Reaches out when slipping — wants to perform at her level
- Sees the world calling with opportunities
- Talent she wants to pour out before time runs out
- Multiple interests, systems thinker, engaged with the future
