# The Six Core Beliefs to Shift

## Overview

| # | Belief | Old (Courtney) | New (Katharine) |
|---|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Core | "The answer is in the next book/program/method" | "The answer is in clearing what's blocking access to what I already know" |
| 2 | Real Problem | "I need more tools, tactics, information" | "I need to stop enacting my own limitation — the block is accessible, not buried" |
| 3 | Time | "I'll figure it out eventually / now isn't the right time" | "Every day I delay, I'm losing days that could have been whole" |
| 4 | Money | "I've already spent so much on programs that didn't work" | "Those programs layered over the pain — this erases the schema" |
| 5 | Method | "I need to meditate/journal/push through/think positive" | "I need to collapse the gap between who I am and who I'm becoming" |
| 6 | Help | "No one can really help me (I'm too smart/complex/broken)" | "The right presence + my fire = the block surfaces and dissolves" |

## Belief 1: CORE BELIEF

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "The fastest way to get unstuck is to find the right book, program, system, or method."

**Why they believe this:**
- It's worked before (they got successful somehow)
- The graveyard of systems proves they're trying
- Intelligence tells them the answer is "out there"

### New Belief (Attract)
> "The fastest way to get unstuck is to clear what's blocking access to what you already know about yourself."

**The shift:**
- You don't need more information — you need less noise
- The answer isn't out there, it's in a part of yourself you don't visit often
- Your intelligence is the asset, not the obstacle

---

## Belief 2: REAL PROBLEM

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "The problem is I need more tools, tactics, frameworks, or information."

**Evidence they use:**
- "I've read all the books"
- "I know about IFS, somatic work, meditation"
- "I've been to the retreats"

### New Belief (Attract)
> "The problem is I'm enacting my own limitation — and the block is accessible, not buried."

**The shift:**
- The block isn't deep — it's right there
- You're not broken, you're just not visiting the part of you that knows
- Bruce Ecker: "Everyone's trauma is equally accessible"

## Belief 3: TIME BELIEF

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "I'll figure it out eventually. Now isn't the right time. I'm too busy."

**Why this keeps them stuck:**
- Environment is full of cues demanding attention
- Meditation "requires" dedicated time they don't have
- Always something more urgent

### New Belief (Attract)
> "Every day I delay, I'm losing days that could have been whole. The fuel is there — the destination isn't."

**The shift:**
- First shift happens immediately, first session
- 12 weeks to permanent change — that's nothing in a life
- "If today was my last, would it have been worth it?"

---

## Belief 4: MONEY BELIEF

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "I've already spent so much on programs that didn't work. Why would this be different?"

**The graveyard as evidence:**
- Executive coaching
- Retreats
- Therapy
- Books
- Apps
- Ayahuasca

### New Belief (Attract)
> "Those programs layered over the pain. This erases the schema. There's a difference between suppressing and dissolving."

**The shift:**
- CBT distracts, suppresses, layers on top — it comes back
- Memory consolidation actually collapses the old schema
- "Once you eliminate a negative emotion about something, you don't have to worry about it popping back up because it doesn't make sense to you anymore"

---

## Belief 5: METHOD BELIEF

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "I need to meditate more, journal more, push through, think positive."

**Why this doesn't work:**
- Positive thinking doesn't work (research proves this)
- Meditation requires time they don't have
- Pushing through builds resentment and exhaustion
- Journaling without structure is just venting

### New Belief (Attract)
> "I need to collapse the gap between who I am and who I'm becoming — not add more practices."

**The shift:**
- Mental contrasting, not positive thinking
- WOOP goals, not SMART goals
- Experiential process, not information transfer
- Neuroadaptive scaffolding, not another system to maintain

---

## Belief 6: HELP BELIEF

### Old Belief (Repel)
> "No one can really help me. I'm too smart/complex/different. I dissect everything before I let it in. Past helpers weren't compelling enough."

**Evidence they use:**
- Therapists who weren't smart enough
- Coaches who couldn't hold the complexity
- Programs that felt like they were for "other people"

### New Belief (Attract)
> "The right presence + my fire = the block surfaces and dissolves. I don't need someone smarter than me — I need someone who believes what I'm blocked by is accessible."

**The shift:**
- You don't need someone to give you answers
- You need someone quiet enough to hold space while you find your own
- Bruce Ecker: Practitioner's conviction that you can recover is half the equation
- No pathologizing, no judgment, no imposing models
- "By being willing to explore the void, you realize how much you know about yourself"

## Content Strategy

For EACH of these 6 beliefs, create content covering:

1. Old belief (what they believe now)
2. Problems it causes today
3. Future cost if they keep it
4. The truth (new belief)
5. New life description
6. Authority quote (Bruce Ecker, etc.)
7. Universal analogy
8. Your personal story
9. Client case study (Katharine)
10. External study (memory reconsolidation research)
11. Internal study (your results)

**6 beliefs × 11 content types = 66 core propaganda pieces**
