# Tripwire Strategy: Core Conversion Content

## The Concept

The full belief-shifting script (6 core beliefs + story) becomes a low-ticket product that:
1. **Shifts all 6 beliefs** in one sitting
2. **Qualifies buyers** (they've paid, not just opted in)
3. **Feeds retargeting** with highest-intent audience
4. **Self-liquidates** (or close to) ad spend
5. **Pre-frames** for Inner Architect

## Format Options

| Format | Length | Price Point | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Video Training | 45-90 min | $27-47 | High engagement, personal | Production time |
| Audio + Workbook | 45-60 min | $17-27 | Easy to consume, portable | Less visual impact |
| Written Guide | 30-40 pages | $7-17 | Fast to produce | Lower perceived value |
| Mini-Course | 3-5 modules | $47-97 | Structured, can drip | More complex |

## Recommended: "The Sovereign Signal" (Video Training)

**Working Title Ideas:**
- "The Sovereign Signal: Why Everything You've Tried Hasn't Worked (And What Will)"
- "The Inner Architect Blueprint: The 6 Beliefs Keeping You Stuck"
- "Stop Trying to Fix Yourself: The Neuroadaptive Truth"

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (5 min) — Your story opening, pattern interrupt
2. **The Problem** (10 min) — Why the graveyard of systems exists
3. **The 6 Beliefs** (30-40 min) — Each belief with your story woven in
4. **The Shift** (10 min) — Memory consolidation, what's actually possible
5. **The Invitation** (5 min) — What working together looks like

**Total: ~60-70 min** (ideal for $27-47 price point)

## Timing Plan

When we write the full script:
1. Read it aloud with natural pauses
2. Target: **60 minutes** for tripwire
3. If longer → standalone product or course
4. If shorter → pad with exercises or extended story segments

## Funnel Flow

```
Cold Traffic
    ↓
Ad (belief-shifting hook)
    ↓
Tripwire Sales Page ($27-47)
    ↓
Purchase → Immediate delivery
    ↓
Retargeting (buyer audience)
    ↓
Middle of Funnel (7 hours consumption)
    ↓
Inner Architect Application
```

## Metrics to Track

- **Cost per tripwire sale** (target: < $30)
- **Tripwire → Inner Architect conversion %**
- **Time from tripwire purchase to application**
- **Self-liquidation rate** (tripwire revenue ÷ ad spend)

## John Whiting's Model (Reference)

He uses the book ($7) as tripwire:
- Not to make money
- To feed retargeting with purchase-intent audience
- Self-liquidates 35-40% of ad spend
- Real money comes from high-ticket (Bulletproof Boardroom)

Your tripwire at $27-47 could potentially self-liquidate higher while doing more belief-shifting work than a book.

## Next Steps

1. Write the full script (all 6 beliefs + story)
2. Time it (target: 60 min)
3. Decide format (video recommended)
4. Build simple sales page
5. Test with retargeting audience first (warmest)
