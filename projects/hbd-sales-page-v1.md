### [BRIDGE]

**You grabbed the checklist to stop replaying conversations.**

Here's the deeper truth:

Those spirals aren't random. They're not a character flaw. They're not "just how you are."

They're run by hidden rules your brain learned decades ago to keep you safe.

The checklist will help you interrupt the loop when it's happening.

But if you want to **dissolve the pattern at its source** — so the loops stop firing in the first place — keep reading.

### [THE OFFER]

## The Hidden Block Decoder™

**A focused system to break the replay loop at its source — in one afternoon.**

This isn't another course to add to the pile. It's not a 12-week program you'll abandon by week 3.

It's a precision tool designed for how your brain actually works — built on memory reconsolidation, the neuroscience of rewriting patterns at their root.

**Price: $97**

### [THIS WORKS EVEN IF...]

**This works even if you've tried everything** — therapy, coaching, CBT, apps, journals, books — and nothing ever sticks for more than two weeks.

Here's why: The Decoder uses memory reconsolidation to update the belief at its source. It doesn't ask you to override the pattern with willpower. It removes the reason the pattern exists.

---

**This works even if you notice the spiral happening but feel powerless to stop it** — like you're watching your brain hijack you in real time.

Here's how: The MOSAEIC Method separates the thoughts, sensations, and feelings that fuel the spiral — so they can't feed each other anymore. The loop loses momentum. You come back without forcing it.

---

**This works even if your patterns feel so deeply ingrained you believe you're too far gone to change.**

Here's why they're not: Your nervous system updates its predictions based on lived experience — not insight, not affirmations, not willpower. The Decoder creates experiences that directly contradict the old belief. And the pattern weakens.

---

**This works even if you're already overwhelmed** and adding one more thing feels impossible.

Here's why that doesn't matter: The MOSAEIC Method works *during* the overwhelm — in the moment, while it's happening. No prep. No journaling. No "doing the work later."

---

**This works without digging into childhood trauma** or emotionally excavating your entire past.

The Decoder intercepts what's happening *now*. You move forward without stepping on landmines or spending years processing every painful memory.

### [WHAT'S INSIDE]

## Here's What You Get Today

**CORE TRAINING**

**1. Your Beautiful Loop** (10-min whiteboard video)
A clear, grounded model of how your mind creates experience. You're introduced to prediction-based reality models, mental competition for awareness, and the self-reflective loop that generates consciousness.

*You finally understand how your mind actually works. What used to feel random now has structure. The fog lifts — you're not trying to control your mind anymore. You're learning how to read it.*

**2. Your Selective Mind** (10-min whiteboard video)
How your brain actively filters, edits, and shapes your internal experience through adaptive narrative control, motivated inattention, and canalization. The mechanics behind how focus becomes habit — and how habit becomes invisible.

*You catch the moment your attention shifts. You don't default into distraction or rumination — you redirect. You move from passive reaction into intentional narrative control.*

**3. The MOSAEIC Method** (Mini-Course)
Mindful Observation • Sensations • Actions • Emotions • Impulses • Cognitions
A real-time system for pulling apart the spiral while it's happening — without prep, without journaling, without "doing the work later."

**4. The IA Blueprint Stack** (9 One-Page Micro-Blueprints)
A set of 9 focused strategy blueprints aligned with each step in the Inner Architect process. Each one helps you spot and resolve a specific hidden mental loop — quickly, without deep analysis.

*Imagine catching yourself mid-spiral, opening the exact right Blueprint, and using its three-step tool to shift from stuck to calm and clear before your next meeting.*

### [ABOUT]

## Who Built This

**Dr. Mani Saint-Victor, MD** spent 14 years working with high-performing professionals — doctors, therapists, executives — who looked successful on the outside but were quietly drowning in replay loops, inner-critic attacks, and self-sabotage patterns that wouldn't quit.

The Hidden Block Decoder is the system he built to give his clients what therapy and coaching couldn't: a way to dissolve the pattern at its source, not just manage the symptoms forever.

---

### [FAQ]

## Common Questions

**How fast will I notice a shift?**
Most people feel changes that same afternoon. Because the Decoder targets the root, not the symptoms, you don't wait months to feel relief.

**What if I've already tried therapy, coaching, and self-help books?**
That's exactly why this exists. Those approaches often manage symptoms instead of dissolving the root pattern. The Decoder works even if nothing else has stuck.

**Will I have to relive painful memories?**
No. The Decoder isn't about excavating trauma. It's about noticing patterns running *now* and dissolving them safely at the source.

**I'm busy — how much time will this take?**
Designed for real life. The core process fits in one afternoon. No hours of journaling or rigid routines required.

**How do I know the change will last?**
The Decoder uses memory reconsolidation — the brain's mechanism for rewriting old patterns. Once a loop dissolves, it doesn't come back. You're free to move forward.

**What if it doesn't work for me?**
You're covered by a 30-day guarantee. Complete the process — if you don't feel a tangible shift, email support for a full refund. Keep everything.
