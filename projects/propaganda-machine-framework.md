## Core Concept

> "Good marketers FIND their ideal customers. Great marketers CREATE their ideal customers."

**Propaganda = Systematic persuasion designed to shift beliefs and shape behavior.**

You're not selling a product. You're selling a **belief system** and an **identity**.

---

## Two Identities to Define

### BEFORE Identity (Hell Island)
- Who they are BEFORE using your solution
- Should be embarrassing/undesirable
- They look at this and think "Shit, that's me. I don't want that."

**For HBD:**
- The Stuck High-Performer
- Replaying conversations, trying every system, nothing sticks
- Hustling but hollow
- Success on paper, stuck in reality
- Can execute for others, can't execute for themselves

### AFTER Identity (Heaven Island)
- Who they become AFTER using your solution
- Should be aspirational, proud to have
- They look at this and think "Yes! That's exactly who I want to be."

**For HBD:**
- The Liberated Analytical Empath
- Pattern recognized, loop broken
- Execution unlocked
- Finally moving on what matters
- Same brain, new operating system

## The 6 Core Beliefs to Shift

Each objection = a belief that needs shifting BEFORE the buying situation.

### Belief 1: CORE BELIEF (Big Domino)
**Old:** "The fastest way to [goal] is [old method]"
**New:** "The fastest way to [goal] is [your mechanism]"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "I need more therapy/coaching/self-help books"
- New: "I need to understand WHY I can't execute (98 blocks) and reconsolidate the memories driving them"

### Belief 2: REAL PROBLEM
**Old:** "The problem is [what they think it is]"
**New:** "The real problem is [what it actually is]"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "I need more motivation/discipline/accountability"
- New: "Your execution system is blocked by protective predictions your brain made years ago"

### Belief 3: TIME
**Old:** "I should do this later / now isn't the right time"
**New:** "Now is the only time / delay costs you more"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "I'll work on this after Q4 / when things calm down"
- New: "Every day you wait, the patterns deepen. The cost of delay compounds."

### Belief 4: MONEY
**Old:** "My money is best spent on [other things]"
**New:** "My money is best spent on [your solution]"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "I should invest in more tactics, ads, team"
- New: "Until you fix the execution engine, everything else is building on a broken foundation"

### Belief 5: METHOD
**Old:** "[Old method] is the best way to get [goal]"
**New:** "[Your method] is the best way to get [goal]"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "Mindset work / willpower / accountability partners"
- New: "Memory reconsolidation + block identification + neuroadaptive scaffolding"

### Belief 6: HELP
**Old:** "I should do this alone / with someone else"
**New:** "Getting help from YOU is the best path"

*For HBD:*
- Old: "I can figure this out myself / my therapist will help"
- New: "You need someone who understands the Analytical Empath brain AND has the tools to rewire it"

## For Each Belief, Create:

1. **Old Belief** - What they currently believe
2. **Problems Old Belief Causes Today** - Complaints, pain, unwanted feelings
3. **Cost of Keeping Old Belief** - Future pain (mental, physical, spiritual, financial, relational)
4. **The Truth** - New belief
5. **Life With New Belief** - Vivid description (the "imagine this" section)
6. **Authority Quote** - Trusted expert backing it up
7. **Universal Analogy** - GPS, house foundation, etc.
8. **Personal Story** - Your hell island → discovery → heaven island
9. **Client Case Study** - Transformation story
10. **External Case Study** - Research/data backing it up
11. **Internal Case Study** - Your program's results

## Funnel Stages & Content

- **Awareness level:** Problem-aware or unaware

### MIDDLE OF FUNNEL (Warm)
- **Goal:** 7 hours of content consumption, shift all 6 beliefs
- **Talk about:** Old way vs new way, your mechanism, belief-shifting content
- **Awareness level:** Solution-aware

### BOTTOM OF FUNNEL (Hot)

## Key Principles

1. **Content = Sales Team** - Your content handles objections before the buying situation
2. **Every objection you get → Make a piece of content that handles it**
3. **Force frequency** - 5+ touches per day through retargeting
4. **Select clips strategically** - Each clip should shift a specific belief
5. **Create ideal customers, don't find them** - Train your audience to be good clients
6. **Pre-frame how to work with you** - Weed out bad fits early

## Application to HBD $97 Page

### The Gap

Memory reconsolidation + Block identification (98 blocks) + MOSAEIC Method

### The 6 Beliefs to Shift on Page

1. **Core:** Fastest way to start executing is understanding your specific blocks
2. **Problem:** It's not motivation—it's protective predictions from past experiences
3. **Time:** Every day without this, patterns deepen
4. **Money:** $97 to unlock what $10K of coaching couldn't
5. **Method:** Memory reconsolidation > mindset work
6. **Help:** You need someone who understands your specific brain wiring

### Proof Stack
- Your personal story (MD → left residency → crashed → rebuilt)
- 870+ clients
- The framework (98 blocks = credibility)
- Research citations from the ChatGPT/Gemini outputs

## Content Ideas from Framework

Each of these could be a reel, YouTube video, or carousel:

1. "Why high-performers can execute for everyone except themselves"
2. "The 3 reasons your therapy didn't work (and what will)"
3. "Why 'just start' advice is useless for Analytical Empaths"
4. "The hidden cost of being the person everyone relies on"
5. "Why your brain is protecting you from the thing you want most"
6. "98 ways your brain blocks execution (which ones do you have?)"
7. "The difference between knowing and doing isn't willpower"
8. "Why successful people get stuck on personal change"

## Next Steps

1. Fill out 6 beliefs with HBD-specific content
2. Rewrite sales page to shift each belief in sequence
3. Create content pieces for each belief (retargeting)
4. Build ManyChat automation for "98" or "BLOCKS" keyword
