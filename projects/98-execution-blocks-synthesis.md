# 98 Execution Blocks — Synthesis Document

*Connecting the Obstacle Matrix, VOC Research, and Deep Research*

---

## Overview

We're building a comprehensive catalog of execution blocks for **high-performing analytical empaths with ADHD traits** — the hidden beliefs, micro-hesitations, and unconscious fears that stop them from acting on what matters.

This document synthesizes three source assets and frames the research output.

---

## Source Assets

### 1. The Obstacle Matrix (81 Obstacles)
**Location:** `/Volumes/Asylum/_Documents/DEPR MOSAEIC Inner Architect Obstacle Matrix - IAS_Obstacle_Catalog_CleanedFormat.csv.csv`

**Structure:** 9 Lessons × 3 Actions × 3 Obstacles = 81 total

**Scope:** Internal to IAS — what stops people from completing the program

**Lessons:**
1. Breakthrough Basics — pattern identification, belief pinpointing
2. Mosaeic Method — applying technique under pressure
3. Replay Loop Breaker — spotting stories, labeling feelings
4. Conviction Gauntlet — reviewing beliefs, analyzing origins
5. Perspective Matrix — identifying bias, exploring viewpoints
6. Vision Accelerator — possibility exploration, identity release
7. Habit Harmonizer — belief internalization, daily practice
8. Execution Engine — action planning, obstacle prediction
9. Growth Anchor — building systems, developing adaptability

**Obstacle Types (from Architect's Compass analysis):**
- **Cognitive/Epistemic** — "I don't believe" (evidence-based resistance)
- **Emotional/Somatic** — "I don't feel safe" (threat response)
- **Behavioral/Structural** — "I don't have capacity" (executive function overload)

### 2. Voice of Customer: 20 Objections
**Location:** `/Users/manisaintvictor/archimedes/projects/voc-20-objections-real-language.md`

**Scope:** Meta-blocks — resistance to trying at all (pre-purchase/pre-commitment)

**Key Language Patterns:**
| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Self-blame tone | "I'm the problem" |
| Abandonment anxiety | "I always give up" |
| Crash prediction | "waiting for the other shoe to drop" |
| Bandwidth language | "drowning," "overwhelmed," "no capacity" |
| Skeptical comparison | "sounds like every other thing I've tried" |
| Fear of hope | "scared to believe," "don't want to get my hopes up" |
| Empath exhaustion | "absorbing everyone else," "lose myself" |
| Analytical paralysis | "replay loop," "can't shut my brain off" |

**Critical insight:** These 20 objections are execution blocks in disguise — they're the blocks about *trying to unblock*.

---

### 3. Deep Research Prompt (Pending)
**Location:** `/Users/manisaintvictor/archimedes/projects/execution-blocks-research-prompt.md`

**Scope:** Life execution — general stuck-ness beyond program completion

**Target profile:**
- High-performing (status, income, reputation, visibility)
- Analytical (pattern-recognizers, systems thinkers)
- Empathic (attuned to others, often in helping roles)
- ADHD traits (interest-based nervous system, time blindness, activation challenges)
- Unfulfilled despite success

**Categories to expand:**
- Identity & Status Blocks
- Permission & Worthiness Blocks
- ADHD-Specific Execution Blocks
- Analytical Mind Blocks
- Empathic Burden Blocks
- Visibility & Authenticity Blocks
- Transition-Specific Blocks

**Total target: 98**

---

## Block Entry Template

Each of the 98 blocks should include:

```markdown
### [Block Name]

**Category:** [e.g., ADHD-Specific]

**The Voice:** "[Exact self-talk in their language]"

**What's Actually Happening:** [Brief mechanism — why this block exists]

**The Trap:** [Why the obvious solution doesn't work for this profile]

**The Move:** [IAS-aligned intervention or protocol]

**Maps to:** [Related Obstacle Matrix item, if applicable]
```

---

## Integration with Architect's Compass

The 98 Execution Blocks becomes the **expanded knowledge base** for the Architect's Compass AI system:

| Compass Component | 98 Blocks Role |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Diagnostician Agent** | Semantic search across 98 blocks to identify current friction |
| **Strategist Agent** | Retrieves "The Move" for matched block |
| **WOOP Obstacle Step** | User selects from filtered block list |
| **Obstacle Radar** | Heatmap of user's frequent block categories |
| **Panic Button** | Routes to appropriate regulation protocol based on block type |

## Processing Workflow (When Research Returns)

### Step 1: Raw Intake
- Receive Perplexity/Gemini research output
- Capture all identified blocks, beliefs, internal monologue examples

### Step 2: Deduplication
- Cross-reference against Obstacle Matrix (81)
- Cross-reference against VOC Objections (20)
- Flag overlaps, merge or differentiate

### Step 3: Categorization
- Assign each block to a category
- Identify category gaps (need more? need fewer?)
- Balance to hit 98 target

### Step 4: Voice Translation
- Rewrite each block in VOC language patterns
- Test: "Would they say this out loud to a friend?"
- Remove clinical/therapeutic framing

### Step 5: Solution Mapping
- Link each block to IAS tools/lessons where applicable
- Create "The Move" for each
- Flag blocks needing new protocols

### Step 6: Final Assembly
- Order within categories (progression or severity)
- Write category intros
- Create index/quick reference

## Existing Obstacle Matrix (81) — Quick Reference

### Lesson 1: Breakthrough Basics
- A1: Overwhelm in identifying priorities, Fear of flaw exposure, Limited self-assessment practice
- A2: Subconscious beliefs hard to access, Resistance to questioning success-linked assumptions, Difficulty linking behaviors to beliefs
- A3: Narratives feel invisible, Impact feels abstract, Emotions distort reflection

### Lesson 2: Mosaeic Method
- A1: Too many competing high-pressure areas, Pressure to be effective everywhere, Unclear which area to prioritize
- A2: Adopting new practices amid busyness, Objectivity challenged by performance mindset, Difficulty maintaining observation consistency
- A3: Narratives hard to observe in real time, Subtle decision biases go unnoticed, Outcome attribution feels speculative

### Lesson 3: Replay Loop Breaker
- A1: Vulnerability in facing discomfort, Root beliefs complex to uncover, Risk of harsh self-judgment
- A2: Emotional overwhelm during prioritization, Ambiguity around "which belief matters most", Interconnected beliefs cloud focus
- A3: Deep beliefs feel too big to break down, Origins are emotionally charged, Motivation dips without quick wins

### Lesson 4: Conviction Gauntlet
- A1: Revisiting pain can retraumatize, Difficulty staying neutral, Insights feel disjointed
- A2: Resistance to challenging identity beliefs, Difficulty separating facts from assumptions, Confirmation bias strengthens old beliefs
- A3: New beliefs may not feel believable, Life doesn't immediately reflect change, Setbacks reinforce old patterns

### Lesson 5: Perspective Matrix
- A1: Self-bias hard to catch, Owning limitations threatens self-image, Multiview thinking causes overwhelm
- A2: Seeking input feels exposing, New views trigger resistance, Integration of insights takes effort
- A3: Hard to shift ingrained negative narratives, Maintaining perspective consistency, Early reframes feel inauthentic

### Lesson 6: Vision Accelerator
- A1: Fear of dreaming "too big", Creative constraints from past roles, Visualizing abstract futures feels unfamiliar
- A2: Resistance to letting go of old identities, Fear of losing competence narrative, Belief shifts create identity dissonance
- A3: Balancing idealism with realism, Aligning with values takes refinement, Translating vision into strategy unclear

### Lesson 7: Habit Harmonizer
- A1: Inconsistent reflection practice, Lingering doubts weaken conviction, Repeating without meaning feels empty
- A2: Real-world stress tests belief strength, Unexpected results shake confidence, Lack of reinforcement discourages follow-through
- A3: Over-customization delays use, Routine fatigue leads to drop-off, Checklist loses relevance over time

### Lesson 8: Execution Engine
- A1: Too many priorities compete, Over-optimizing delays action, Unrealistic plans lead to shutdown
- A2: Poor anticipation causes friction, Solutions feel too theoretical, Overplanning creates rigidity
- A3: Fear of judgment blocks outreach, Dismissing feedback due to pride, Support network isn't aligned

### Lesson 9: Growth Anchor
- A1: Hard to design adaptable structure, Life integration feels disruptive, Progress hard to measure
- A2: Change triggers uncertainty, Flexibility outside comfort zone, Stress hijacks resilience
- A3: Trust issues limit connection, Support may not match growth pace, Difficulty sustaining mutual commitment

## Notes

- **Empowerment framing only** — capability, agency, self-determination
- **No clinical/therapeutic language** — not pathology, not healing
- **Real language** — if it doesn't sound like something they'd say to a friend at 2am, rewrite it
- **The goal:** Recognition, not shame. "Oh shit, that's me" followed by "and here's what to do about it"
