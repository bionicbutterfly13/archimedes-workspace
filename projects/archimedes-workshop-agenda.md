# Workshop: Building Your Neuroadaptive Scaffolding System

*Setting up your own "Archimedes" — an AI-powered external structure for Vigilant Sentinels*

---

## The Problem We're Solving

High-performing people with ADHD traits have succeeded by building external scaffolding — deadlines, accountability, urgency. But that scaffolding was built *for* them (by jobs, clients, crises).

When it comes to personal transformation, there's no external structure. No deadline. No one checking in. The interest-based nervous system has nothing to grab onto.

**This workshop:** We build the scaffolding ourselves — an AI system that holds context, remembers what we forget, and shows up even when we don't.

## Workshop Agenda

### Part 1: The Foundation (20 min)
**What we're building and why it works**

- The "second brain that talks back" concept
- Why flat notes fail the ADHD brain (no activation energy to retrieve)
- How an AI agent provides *on-demand* externalized clarity
- The workspace as your cognitive home base

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 1 (Breakthrough Basics) — creating the map of who you are

---

### Part 2: Identity Architecture (15 min)
**Setting up SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md**

- SOUL.md — Who is the AI? Personality, boundaries, vibe
- USER.md — Who are you? Preferences, context, what to avoid
- IDENTITY.md — The AI's self-concept (optional but powerful)
- Why explicit identity prevents drift and generic responses

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 4 (Conviction Gauntlet) — beliefs need to be written to become real

---

### Part 3: Memory Systems (20 min)
**MEMORY.md + daily logs — continuity across sessions**

- The wake-up-fresh problem: AI has no persistence by default
- Daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — raw capture of what happened
- MEMORY.md — curated long-term memory (like your own hippocampus)
- When to write vs. when to let it flow
- The AI reviewing its own memories (meta-cognition)

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 5 (Perspective Matrix) — external record creates objectivity

---

### Part 4: The Heartbeat System (15 min)
**Proactive check-ins — the AI that reaches out**

- HEARTBEAT.md — what should the AI check periodically?
- The "few times a day" rhythm vs. always-on noise
- What makes a good heartbeat task (batch checks, not individual pings)
- Cron jobs for precise timing (reminders, scheduled tasks)

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 7 (Habit Harmonizer) — externalized consistency beats willpower

---

### Part 5: The Execution Layer (15 min)
**Projects, tools, and getting things done**

- The `projects/` folder — active work with context
- TOOLS.md — your local cheat sheet (cameras, SSH, voices)
- Skills — specialized instructions for specific tasks
- How to ask for help vs. how to delegate entirely

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 8 (Execution Engine) — structure at the point of performance

---

### Part 6: Safety & Boundaries (10 min)
**What the AI should and shouldn't do**

- AGENTS.md — the operating manual
- External vs. internal actions (ask first vs. do freely)
- Group chat behavior (participate, don't dominate)
- Privacy: what stays private, what can be shared

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 6 (Vision Accelerator) — boundaries enable freedom

---

### Part 7: Live Setup (30 min)
**Building it together — screen share walkthrough**

1. Create the workspace folder
2. Write SOUL.md (personality, vibe, boundaries)
3. Write USER.md (who you are, preferences)
4. Write AGENTS.md (operating instructions)
5. Create memory/ folder + first daily log
6. Set up HEARTBEAT.md (what to check)
7. First conversation — test the system

---

### Part 8: Integration & Next Steps (10 min)
**Making it stick**

- The first 48 hours — what to capture
- When to update MEMORY.md (not daily, periodically)
- How to evolve the system as you learn
- Connecting to the 9-step journey

**Maps to IAS:** Lesson 9 (Growth Anchor) — the system grows with you

---

## How This Maps to the 9 Steps

| IAS Lesson | Scaffolding Element | Function |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| 1. Breakthrough Basics | USER.md, initial setup | Map who you are |
| 2. Mosaeic Method | Heartbeat check-ins | Observe in real-time |
| 3. Replay Loop Breaker | AI as pattern interruptor | External perspective when spiraling |
| 4. Conviction Gauntlet | MEMORY.md, written beliefs | Beliefs become real when written |
| 5. Perspective Matrix | AI offers alternatives | Built-in reframe partner |
| 6. Vision Accelerator | Projects folder, goals | Vision with structure |
| 7. Habit Harmonizer | Heartbeats, cron jobs | Externalized consistency |
| 8. Execution Engine | Task delegation, tools | Structure at point of performance |
| 9. Growth Anchor | Evolving memory system | Grows with you over time |

## Key Phrases to Use

- "Externalized clarity" — getting it out of your head and into structure
- "Structure at the point of performance" — help when you need it, not before
- "Activation energy" — the spark needed to start (AI lowers this)
- "Interest-based nervous system" — why urgency/novelty matter
- "Neuroadaptive scaffolding" — structure that adapts to how your brain works
- "Cognitive home base" — one place where context lives
- "Second brain that talks back" — not just storage, active partnership
- "Vigilant Sentinel" — (sparingly) the high-performer with ADHD traits

## What They'll Walk Away With

1. A working AI workspace configured to their identity
2. Understanding of why this works for their brain type
3. A memory system that creates continuity
4. A heartbeat rhythm for proactive support
5. Clear connection to the 9-step transformation journey
