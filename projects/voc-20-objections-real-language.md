## The 20 Objections

### 1. Trust & Self-Doubt
**Original:** "If I can't even trust myself to follow a simple system, how will external scaffolding help me?"
**Their Words:** "I can't trust myself anymore—how is relying on something outside me gonna help when I'm the problem?"

### 2. Crutch Fear
**Original:** "It sounds like a crutch. Won't I become dependent on it instead of actually changing?"
**Their Words:** "This just sounds like another crutch. What if I become so dependent on it that I can't function without it?"

### 3. System Graveyard
**Original:** "I've tried productivity systems before. They help for a week, then I fall off."
**Their Words:** "I have a graveyard of systems that worked for two weeks max, then I abandoned them like everything else."

### 4. Loop Paralysis
**Original:** "If I'm in a full-blown loop, how will I even remember to use the system?"
**Their Words:** "When I'm deep in a replay loop, I can't even remember my own name—how am I supposed to remember to use a system?"

### 5. Overwhelm & Bandwidth
**Original:** "This sounds really complex. I'm already overwhelmed—I don't have bandwidth to learn something new."
**Their Words:** "I'm already drowning trying to keep my head above water. I don't have the bandwidth to learn something this complex."

### 6. Nothing Worked Fast Enough
**Original:** "I've done trauma work, coaching, and CBT. Nothing made these loops collapse that fast."
**Their Words:** "I've tried therapy, coaching, CBT—nothing has ever made these loops collapse from hours to minutes. I'm skeptical."

### 7. Speed Skepticism
**Original:** "This can't possibly collapse something that usually consumes hours—in minutes."
**Their Words:** "There's no way something that eats up my entire day can just... collapse in minutes. That doesn't make sense."

### 8. Personal Fit Doubt
**Original:** "It sounds like it only works for people with certain types of ADHD—what if mine is different?"
**Their Words:** "What if my ADHD is different? What if I'm the type this doesn't work for?"

### 9. Relapse Fear
**Original:** "Even if it works, I'll probably just relapse into the same patterns later."
**Their Words:** "Even if this works now, I'm just waiting for the crash. I always relapse back into the same patterns."

### 10. Excavation Fatigue
**Original:** "If this works without emotional excavation, how can it actually be sustainable?"
**Their Words:** "How can this actually stick if I'm not digging through decades of emotional crap? It feels too easy."

### 11. Differentiation Doubt
**Original:** "How is this any different from all the other 'systems' and 'frameworks' out there?"
**Their Words:** "How is this different from every other framework I've tried? They all sound the same."

### 12. Neuroscience Buzzwords
**Original:** "Is this just another habit tracker or set of checklists dressed up as neuroscience?"
**Their Words:** "Is this just another fancy habit tracker with 'neuroscience' slapped on it?"

### 13. Self-Abandonment Pattern
**Original:** "If I'm the one who always abandons things, won't I just abandon this too?"
**Their Words:** "I'm the person who abandons everything. Why would this be any different?"

### 14. Commitment Paralysis
**Original:** "I can barely trust myself to get through a podcast. How can I get through a whole 12-week system?"
**Their Words:** "I can't even finish a podcast without my brain wandering off. How am I supposed to commit to 12 weeks?"

### 15. Avoiding Responsibility
**Original:** "Isn't 'externalizing clarity' just avoiding responsibility?"
**Their Words:** "Doesn't this just let me off the hook? Isn't 'externalizing' just avoiding personal responsibility?"

### 16. Life Restructure Fear
**Original:** "Won't I have to restructure my whole life to make this work?"
**Their Words:** "Will I have to blow up my entire life to make this work? Because I can't handle that right now."

### 17. Hope Fatigue
**Original:** "This feels like too big of a shift to trust—I don't want to get my hopes up again."
**Their Words:** "I've gotten my hopes up too many times before. I'm scared to believe this will actually work."

### 18. Therapy Jargon
**Original:** "I've heard terms like 'scaffolding' before—is this just therapy language?"
**Their Words:** "I've heard all this 'scaffolding' talk before. Is this just more therapy buzzwords?"

### 19. Temporary Relief Fear
**Original:** "I'm afraid it'll work temporarily, but then stop helping when I need it most."
**Their Words:** "What if it works now, but then crashes when I need it most? I can't go through that again."

### 20. Forever Dependence
**Original:** "I don't want to need a system forever just to feel like I can function."
**Their Words:** "I don't want to need a system for the rest of my life just to function like a normal person."

## Notes

These objections honor the intersection of being:
- **Analytical** — overthinking, meta-analyzing
- **Empathic** — absorbing others, people-pleasing burnout
- **ADHD** — can't trust self, systems fail, executive dysfunction

Use these patterns when writing the 98 Execution Blocks — the language should feel like it came from their own mouth.
