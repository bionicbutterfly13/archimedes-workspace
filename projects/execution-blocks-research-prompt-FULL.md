# Deep Research Prompt: 98 Execution Blocks for High-Performing Analytical Empaths with ADHD Traits

*Self-contained document for Perplexity / Gemini Deep Research*

---

## THE RESEARCH GOAL

I'm building a comprehensive catalog of **98 execution blocks** — the hidden beliefs, micro-hesitations, and unconscious fears that prevent a specific type of high achiever from acting on what actually matters to them.

I need you to help me identify and articulate these blocks using research from psychology, behavioral science, ADHD literature, high-achiever psychology, and decision science.

## THE TARGET PROFILE

**High-performing analytical empaths with ADHD traits who feel unfulfilled despite success.**

Specifics:
- **High-performing** — already successful by external measures: status, income, reputation, visibility
- **Analytical** — pattern-recognizers, systems thinkers, deep processors
- **Empathic** — highly attuned to others' emotions, often in helping/advisory roles (medicine, therapy, coaching, leadership, education)
- **ADHD traits** — whether diagnosed or not: interest-based nervous system, novelty-seeking, hyperfocus capability, time blindness, difficulty with sustained effort on low-stimulation tasks, emotional intensity
- **Unfulfilled despite success** — have the markers they were "supposed to" chase, but feel hollow. Know something needs to change. Can't seem to move.

**The paradox:** They've achieved elite success — often *because* of their unique wiring (hyperfocus, pattern recognition, empathy). But that success was built on external structure, urgency, and novelty. Now they want to pursue something *personally meaningful* — and their usual execution strategies don't work.

**Why this combination is particularly stuck:**
- Their analytical mind sees every possible obstacle before starting
- Their empathy makes them hyperaware of how change affects everyone around them
- Their ADHD means they can only execute when it's interesting, urgent, or novel — and deep personal change is none of those until it's a crisis
- They've succeeded by building external scaffolding (deadlines, accountability, high stakes) — but can't create that scaffolding for themselves
- Shame from a lifetime of "not living up to potential" despite visible success

## WHAT I ALREADY HAVE (DON'T DUPLICATE)

I have an existing **Obstacle Matrix of 81 blocks** specific to completing a transformation program. These are already catalogued — please **expand beyond these**, not rediscover them:

### Existing Obstacles (81) — For Reference Only

**Lesson 1: Breakthrough Basics**
- Overwhelm in identifying priorities
- Fear of flaw exposure
- Limited self-assessment practice
- Subconscious beliefs hard to access
- Resistance to questioning success-linked assumptions
- Difficulty linking behaviors to beliefs
- Narratives feel invisible
- Impact feels abstract
- Emotions distort reflection

**Lesson 2: Mosaeic Method**

## VOICE OF CUSTOMER — HOW THEY ACTUALLY TALK

From Reddit, YouTube, and forums where analytical empaths with ADHD actually speak. **Use these language patterns** when articulating the blocks:

**Sample statements (actual quotes):**
- "I can't trust myself anymore—how is relying on something outside me gonna help when I'm the problem?"
- "I have a graveyard of systems that worked for two weeks max, then I abandoned them like everything else."
- "When I'm deep in a replay loop, I can't even remember my own name—how am I supposed to remember to use a system?"
- "I'm already drowning trying to keep my head above water. I don't have the bandwidth to learn something this complex."
- "There's no way something that eats up my entire day can just... collapse in minutes. That doesn't make sense."
- "What if my ADHD is different? What if I'm the type this doesn't work for?"
- "Even if this works now, I'm just waiting for the crash. I always relapse back into the same patterns."
- "How can this actually stick if I'm not digging through decades of emotional crap? It feels too easy."
- "How is this different from every other framework I've tried? They all sound the same."
- "I'm the person who abandons everything. Why would this be any different?"
- "I can't even finish a podcast without my brain wandering off. How am I supposed to commit to 12 weeks?"
- "Will I have to blow up my entire life to make this work? Because I can't handle that right now."
- "I've gotten my hopes up too many times before. I'm scared to believe this will actually work."
- "I don't want to need a system for the rest of my life just to function like a normal person."

**Key language patterns:**
| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Self-blame tone | "I'm the problem" |
| Abandonment anxiety | "I always give up" |
| Crash prediction | "waiting for the other shoe to drop" |
| Bandwidth language | "drowning," "overwhelmed," "no capacity" |
| Skeptical comparison | "sounds like every other thing I've tried" |
| Fear of hope | "scared to believe," "don't want to get my hopes up" |
| Empath exhaustion | "absorbing everyone else," "lose myself" |
| Analytical paralysis | "replay loop," "can't shut my brain off" |

## CATEGORIES TO EXPLORE (AND EXPAND)

### Identity & Status Blocks
1. **Golden handcuffs** — "I can't walk away from what I've built"
2. **Identity capture** — "This is who I am now", trapped by the successful persona
3. **Reputation protection** — "What will colleagues/peers think if I pivot"
4. **Status anxiety** — fear of being seen as falling, failing, regressing
5. **Imposter escalation** — "If I change, they'll realize I was faking it"
6. **Legacy sunk cost** — "I can't undo decades of building this"

### Permission & Worthiness Blocks

13. **Time blindness** — "I'll start Monday" (every week for years)
14. **Decision fatigue doom loops** — too many options, pick none
15. **Activation energy deficit** — knowing exactly what to do, can't initiate
16. **Shame spirals** — history of "failed" attempts creates anticipatory defeat
17. **All-or-nothing thinking** — "If I can't do it perfectly/completely, why start"
18. **Novelty addiction** — the *idea* of change is exciting; execution is boring
19. **Waiting for the right mood** — "I need to feel ready/inspired"
20. **External structure dependency** — can't self-generate urgency or accountability

## CRITICAL FRAMING CONSTRAINTS

✅ **DO use:**
- Empowerment framing — agency, capability, self-determination
- Recognition language — "oh shit, that's me"
- Solvable framing — these are obstacles, not character flaws
- Real human voice — how they'd describe it to a friend at 2am

❌ **DO NOT use:**
- Clinical/pathology language
- Therapeutic/healing framing
- "Disorder" framing
- "Midlife crisis" framing
- Recovery language
- Medical terminology

**The goal:** A comprehensive reference that high-performing analytical empaths with ADHD traits can see themselves in — specific enough to trigger recognition, framed as solvable, not shameful.
